                  <p>Many IT projects that use the traditional waterfall approach of extensive design upfront do not work well, are delivered late, or are over budget.</p> 

                  <p>This project is utilising an agile approach. The agile approach is one of iterative development in rapid cycles will allow data to be made available in the phased manner. The agile development principles encourage active ‘user’ involvement throughout the product’s development and will serve to ensure that the data provision is responsive to user needs. Civil society and citizens’ inputs will be incorporated into the IT development, in order to ensure product development
                  alignment to user needs.</p> 
                  
                  <p>A number of opportunities for civil society engagement and partnership with the project have been identified along the full life-cycle of the project.</p>
