- Component is used to provide user with functionality to share the current page via Facebook, Twitter or just copy as a link.
- For Facebook and Twitter a new window is opened that has the FB / Twitter specific URL with the required query strings.
- To copy the link a modal is opened (via a Redux action creator) with the URL for a user to copy.
