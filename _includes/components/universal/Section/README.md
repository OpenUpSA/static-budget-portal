# Section

## Overview

`Section` should form the backbone of how you seperate groups of content inside the `Page` component. By default this component takes on the appearance of a traditional UI card component. However, it has the capacity to appear beveled with more than one card nested inside of it to create another level of content grouping. In addition, a modifier can be passed to the component to only use it's padding and structure without the styling. 

It is recommended to not nest component directly inside the Page component without having a `Section` component as a middle-man.
