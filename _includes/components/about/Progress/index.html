            <p><strong>Planning</strong></p>

            <p>A Project Steering Committee and Operational Working Group comprised of National Treasury officials and representatives of IMALI YETHU was set up to provide strategic and operational guidance to the project. The Government Technical Advisory Centre was brought on board to support with the planning and project management of the project.</p>
            
            <p>A project planning phase was undertaken to scope the project, working together with Civil Society organisations. Thereafter, an open tender process was undertaken to secure a service provider to support the implementation of the project. In keeping with the partnership approach, Civil Society Organisations observed the procurement process. The tender was awarded to OpenUp. The official project commencement date was 4th August 2017.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Stage One</strong></p>

            <p>Stage one laid the foundation for the project. The vulekamali name was chosen through a naming competition and the portal was official launched in February 2017 by the Minister of Finance.</p>
            
            <p>The Estimates of National Expenditure (ENE) and Estimates of Provincial Revenue and Expenditure (EPRE) documents and datasets were made available through the website during this stage.</p>
            
            <p>During stage one there were two hackathons and three Data Quests. The hackathons were held in Cape Town and Johannesburg and participants worked with the data available through the vulekamali API.</p>
            
            <p>Data Quests were held in Tshwane, Cape Town and Mbombela. The Data Quests were designed to understand user needs in order to direct the development of the portal.</p>
            
            <p>Stage one also included a series of civic information events in Mpumalanga, where the vulekamali project team introduced communities and local government to the vulekamali project and conducted workshops on budget analysis and advocacy.</p>
