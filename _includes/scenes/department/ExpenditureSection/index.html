      <p class="js-tooltips">
        Budgeted and actual expenditure/allocations for a department can increase or decrease from year to year. Changes in expenditure for a department can be because of changes in the activities of the department, because of changes in priorities between departments, because of cost efficiencies or because of increases in the price of goods and services due to inflation.
      </p>

      <p class="js-tooltips">
        The chart shows the department’s actual expenditure for past years, and budgeted expenditure for the current year and the upcoming three years of the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). By adjusting these numbers to take inflation into account, it is possible to determine if a department’s expenditure is really increasing or decreasing in real terms, as compared to the rest of the economy.
