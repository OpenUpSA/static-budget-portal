During stage one there will be a series of DataQuests designed to understand user needs, in order to direct the development of the portal.

The first DataQuest has already been held in Pretoria on 26 September 2017. The purpose of the Data Quest is soley to understand the needs of potential users of the data in order to determine the user features that will need to be developed for the portal.

Different participants who are passionate about government policy analysis and its supporting data, from government, private sector and civil society were in attendance and participated in discussions and provided inputs.

On 22 November 2017, there was a second DataQuest in Cape Town, followed by a two-day Hackathon on 23 and 24 November 2017. This is in line with the agile IT development process that is being used for this project. DataQuests are planned for each Province.
