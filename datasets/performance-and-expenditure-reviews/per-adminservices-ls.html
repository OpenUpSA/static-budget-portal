  description: Performance Expenditure Reviews (PERs) either assess baseline expenditure
    on existing programme or cost the implementation of a new or substantially changed
    policy. They include a policy and institutional analysis, a programme logic analysis,
    a key performance indicator analysis, and a cost and savings model.  These analysis
    involve the detailed scrutiny of programme performance and expenditure datasets
    to quantify, assess, and improve the cost effectiveness of public policy and public
    spending.

  \ recognises 11 official languages, all of which are equally esteemed and must be\

  \ positive measures to elevate the status and use of all these languages.\u200B"
