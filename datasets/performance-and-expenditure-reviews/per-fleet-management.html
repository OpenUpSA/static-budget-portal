  description: Performance Expenditure Reviews (PERs) either assess baseline expenditure
    on existing programme or cost the implementation of a new or substantially changed
    policy. They include a policy and institutional analysis, a programme logic analysis,
    a key performance indicator analysis, and a cost and savings model.  These analysis
    involve the detailed scrutiny of programme performance and expenditure datasets
    to quantify, assess, and improve the cost effectiveness of public policy and public
    spending.

description: There is a lack of a comprehensive policy framework for fleet management.
  The National Transport Circular 4 of 2000 is outdated; while it is currently being
  updated, it only covers the authorisation and usage of individual vehicles. Provinces
  have to compile their own policies, procedures and management practices for determining
  fleet size, age usage and composition.
