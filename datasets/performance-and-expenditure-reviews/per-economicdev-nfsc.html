  description: Performance Expenditure Reviews (PERs) either assess baseline expenditure
    on existing programme or cost the implementation of a new or substantially changed
    policy. They include a policy and institutional analysis, a programme logic analysis,
    a key performance indicator analysis, and a cost and savings model.  These analysis
    involve the detailed scrutiny of programme performance and expenditure datasets
    to quantify, assess, and improve the cost effectiveness of public policy and public
    spending.

description: "In the mid-1990s, government introduced the Integrated Nutrition Programme.\
  \ It aimed to improve the health of the poor by delivering a range of nutrition-specific\
  \ interventions (e.g. vitamin supplementation, deworming, and nutrition education)\
  \ and complementary interventions (e.g. the provision of water, sanitation and income\
  \ support to indigent households). However, malnutrition remains a significant challenge.\
  \ The most recent data shows that one in four children aged 1\u20133 years are stunted,\
  \ which is higher than in countries with comparable levels of income. Malnutrition\
  \ contributes to the relatively high levels of sickness and death among children:\
  \ of the children who died before age 5 in 2008, more than 60% were underweight\
  \ and 30% were severely malnourished."
