  description: Performance Expenditure Reviews (PERs) either assess baseline expenditure
    on existing programme or cost the implementation of a new or substantially changed
    policy. They include a policy and institutional analysis, a programme logic analysis,
    a key performance indicator analysis, and a cost and savings model.  These analysis
    involve the detailed scrutiny of programme performance and expenditure datasets
    to quantify, assess, and improve the cost effectiveness of public policy and public
    spending.

description: Although significant progress has been made in providing water to households
  and communities who had no access to these services before 1994, sizeable backlogs
  remain. According to the 2011 census, 2.2 million households still lack access to
  the RDP-standard water supply, and over 5 million households (or 33%) experience
  problems with their supply. Growth in sectors such as agriculture, mining and energy
  also depends heavily on reliable access to water.
