      policy. They include a policy and institutional analysis, a programme logic
      analysis, a key performance indicator analysis, and a cost and savings model.  These

  description: There is wide agreement that South Africa produces too few artisans
    to meet the needs of the economy and that improving the efficiency and effectiveness
    of the artisan development system is important for accelerating growth and reducing
    unemployment. Indeed, the National Development Plan (NDP) sets a target of producing
    30 000 artisans a year by 2030, which would be more than double the number of
    artisans who graduated in 2013. (This was already considerably higher than the
    low point of 2005, when only 4 500 artisans graduated.)

  description: "The biofuels regulatory framework aims to encourage the production\
    \ of biofuel on a commercial scale by establishing transparent criteria for selecting\
    \ biofuel manufacturing projects. To achieve a 2% penetration of biofuels into\
    \ the local transport fuel pool, an incentive scheme was announced in 2013 that\
    \ will provide a guaranteed return on assets of 15% to an efficient biofuels producer.\
    \ It is hoped that the commercial production of biofuels will stimulate significant\
    \ economic development and employment in the agricultural sector. The fiscal production\
    \ incentive for biofuels will be funded by a biofuels levy on all petrol and diesel\
    \ sold for domestic consumption. The level of the incentive required to generate\
    \ the 15% return on assets in an indicative efficient biofuels plant will be determined\
    \ on a monthly basis via a biofuels incentive model. Should a biofuels manufacturer\u2019\
    s return on assets exceed 20%, a \u2018claw-back\u2019 would come into effect,\
    \ in terms of which it would pay the \u2018excessive\u2019 profits back to the\
    \ subsidy scheme"

  description: "In many developed countries, people with scarce skills receive preferential\
    \ treatment in the immigration process and some are even proactively sourced,\
    \ as skilled immigrants help accelerate growth and create jobs. In South Africa,\
    \ the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) intends to shift the formal immigration\
    \ policy from trying to protect domestic workers to seeking actively to alleviate\
    \ the country\u2019s skills shortages. This is in line with the National Development\
    \ Plan, which set a target of 50 000 scarce-skill visas to be issued by 2030.\
    \ In terms of DHA policy, foreign workers with scarce skills may apply for a category\
    \ of work visa called critical skills visas (CSVs)."

    on payment systems was estimated and then projected forward from 2017/2018 to

  description: To enhance the quality of teaching and the outcomes of the basic education
    system, the national Department of Basic Education (DBE) developed a plan for
    the in-service training of teachers (INSET). The goal is to deepen their subject
    expertise as well as their pedagogical knowledge. The Integrated Strategic Planning
    Framework for Teacher Education and Development in South Africa emerged from extensive
    research and collaboration among a range of stakeholders, including provincial
    education departments, academics and teacher unions. It specifies what educators
    should know, and having established the nature of the gaps, identifies suitable
    institutions to provide the required training. The policy proposals are extensive
    and will require substantial public resources to implement.

    \ Act in 1994 and the opening of the land claims process in 1995. The aim was\
    \ to return a significant proportion of land forcibly taken from individuals and\
    \ communities after the passage of the 1913 Land Act, and the Commission of Restitution\
    \ of Land Rights was established to undertake this process. Eligible claimants\
    \ were given three years from 1 May 1995 to lodge claims, which was later extended\
    \ to 31 December 1998. By that point, around 60 000 claims had been lodged, some\
    \ of which were for more than one property."

    \ to expand production, particularly in communal land areas and on smallholdings\
    \ with a variety of tenure systems. MAFISA\u2019s approach was to channel funds\
    \ appropriated to the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF)\
    \ through the Land Bank to established financial intermediaries who would make\
    \ loans of up to R500 000 to farmers. The programme\u2019s rules meant that the\
    \ bulk of borrowed funds were to be used to pay suppliers of agricultural equipment\
    \ and other inputs. MAFISA loan agreements stipulated that financial intermediaries\
    \ generally would not pay the borrowed funds to the beneficiary, but would pay\
    \ the suppliers of approved inputs and services directly.\u200B"

    \ It aimed to improve the health of the poor by delivering a range of nutrition-specific\
    \ interventions (e.g. vitamin supplementation, deworming, and nutrition education)\
    \ and complementary interventions (e.g. the provision of water, sanitation and\
    \ income support to indigent households). However, malnutrition remains a significant\
    \ challenge. The most recent data shows that one in four children aged 1\u2013\
    3 years are stunted, which is higher than in countries with comparable levels\
    \ of income. Malnutrition contributes to the relatively high levels of sickness\
    \ and death among children: of the children who died before age 5 in 2008, more\
    \ than 60% were underweight and 30% were severely malnourished."

  description: "Post-school education and training (PSET) is critical to South Africa\u2019\
    s future socio-economic development. It dramatically improves the employment prospects\
    \ of young people and raises their incomes from such employment. In addition,\
    \ broadening the skills base would be socially and economically transformative,\
    \ and promote economic and employment growth. A primary goal of the PSET system\
    \ has been to increase access to higher education and skills training. Government\
    \ has expanded the capacity of the universities and the technical and vocational\
    \ education and training (TVET) colleges, while also increasing funding for workplace\
    \ training. University enrolment has grown rapidly, but enrolment at TVET colleges\
    \ has grown even faster. The main mechanism for increasing access to the PSET\
    \ system for young people from poor households has been the National Student Financial\
    \ Aid Scheme (NSFAS), which has grown significantly. \u200B"

  description: The main purpose of this performance and expenditure review (PER) was
    to understand how much is being spent on provincial roads, what drives this expenditure,
    and what is being delivered. The aim was to identify where spending might be inefficient,
    which could inform policy decisions and improve value for money. The PER aimed
    to analyse the unit cost per kilometre of provincial roads, taking into account
    the different costs structures across provinces due to topographical, climatic,
    soil and other differences.

  description: "Provincial roads are a vital cog in the South African economy, and\
    \ key to ensuring access to social services. They are generally a high-use infrastructure,\
    \ the condition of which has a significant impact on users\u2019 experience and\
    \ their potential contribution to economic activity. The need to maintain roads\
    \ does not wait for provincial road management systems to be in place or for budget\
    \ processes to run their course, with the costs of maintenance rising exponentially\
    \ with the deterioration of their condition. Furthermore, what happens in one\
    \ section of the network can dramatically affect other parts. If a stretch of\
    \ road goes into disrepair, fewer people use that section, which has an impact\
    \ on alternate routes and feeder roads. At any one time, there are many sections\
    \ of road in a network that require work, but resource constraints mean that only\
    \ a small proportion can be selected for work to be done. This document is a report\
    \ on a performance expenditure review (PER) on provincial roads. The key output\
    \ of this PER is a costing model that enables users to develop cost estimates\
    \ of a variety of kinds of roads projects in a variety of different conditions.\
    \ The costing model can be applied and adapted to all conditions that exist in\
    \ South Africa if the relevant data is provided and input. The model can generate\
    \ estimates for all conditions, though some judgement will be required if it is\
    \ to be used optimally. Users can utilise the model to obtain alternate costings\
    \ of projects by tweaking variables, and therefore have a powerful tool to quickly\
    \ compare different approaches to the same sections of roads. This also supports\
    \ institutional knowledge accumulation and learning as officials can quickly compare\
    \ the impact of these differences on project costs."

    the costs and revenues associated with provincial government renting state-owned
    residential properties to private tenants in the period 2013/14 to 2015/16.


    The key objectives of the project were to:


    - Identify and quantify all costs and revenues associated with the management
    of state-owned residential rental properties by provincial governments.

    - Assess the quality and comprehensiveness of available data on leases and rentals.

    - Estimate the discrepancy between rentals charged and market-related rates that
    could be obtained for similar properties.

    - Identify weaknesses in rent-collection systems and processes and make recommendations
    to address them.

    - Make recommendations to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of property
    rental processes.'

    description: Performance Expenditure Reviews (PERs) either assess baseline expenditure
      on existing programme or cost the implementation of a new or substantially changed
      policy. They include a policy and institutional analysis, a programme logic
      analysis, a key performance indicator analysis, and a cost and savings model.  These
      analysis involve the detailed scrutiny of programme performance and expenditure
      datasets to quantify, assess, and improve the cost effectiveness of public policy
      and public spending.

  description: Although significant progress has been made in providing water to households
    and communities who had no access to these services before 1994, sizeable backlogs
    remain. According to the 2011 census, 2.2 million households still lack access
    to the RDP-standard water supply, and over 5 million households (or 33%) experience
    problems with their supply. Growth in sectors such as agriculture, mining and
    energy also depends heavily on reliable access to water.
