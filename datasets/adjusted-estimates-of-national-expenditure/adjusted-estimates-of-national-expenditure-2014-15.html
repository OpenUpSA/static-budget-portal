    \ year, the adjustments budget process provides an opportunity to make permissible\
    \ revisions to the main Budget, as contained in ENE publications, in response\
    \ to changes that have affected the planned government spending for that year.\
    \ These adjustments for the current year are contained in an adjustments appropriation\
    \ bill. The Adjusted Estimates of National Expenditure (AENE) publication contains\
    \ detailed data on these mid-year adjustments as well as the revised current year\
    \ revenue and expenditure estimates."
