intro: "This brief analysis the budget allocations for the Eastern Cape Department\
  \ of Education\r\n(ECDoE) in relation to the progressive realisation of the rights\
  \ to quality basic education within\r\nProgramme 2: Public Ordinary Schools Education\
  \ for the 2018/19 financial year. This brief is situated\r\nwithin the planning\
  \ and resource allocation processes of the social accountability system (SAM), and\r\
  \nusing a rights-based approach to evaluating resource allocation for Programme\
  \ 2. This approach places\r\nan obligation on the state to fulfill the rights of\
  \ citizens to quality basic education, as enshrined in Section 29 of the Constitution.\
  \ The state has an obligation to progressively realise the rights of citizens to\
  \ quality basic education, and to access and use available resources optimally and\
  \ equitably in doing so. In addition, the purpose of this brief is to analyse the\
  \ change in budget allocations from the Adjusted\r\nAppropriations of the 2017/18\
  \ financial year, nominal and real budget allocations for the 2018/19\r\nfinancial\
  \ year, as well as percent (%) changes in budget allocations for this financial\
  \ year. In order\r\ndetermine the allocations in real terms, this brief makes use\
  \ of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This is\r\nmeant to show the effect of inflation\
  \ on the purchasing power within the specific Programmes. While\r\ngovernment focuses\
  \ on the nominal allocations, this brief accounts for the effects of inflation.\
  \ This takes\r\ninto account that building new schools, for example, will be more\
  \ expensive this financial year than the\r\nlast financial year. As such, government\
  \ must ensure that budget allocations take inflation into account\r\neach year."
