intro: "This paper outlines some trends in South Africa\u2019s economic situation,\
  \ its national and provincial health allocations generally, HIV and TB allocations\
  \ and spending, and then take a closer look at spending trends at provincial and\
  \ sub-programme levels in 2016/17. Our analyses are based on 2013/14 - 2018/19 budget\
  \ and expenditure documents, as well as 2016/17 provincial HIV CG Evaluation Report\
  \ and CG quarterly reports.  \r\n\r\nSome achievements in the HIV and TB spending\
  \ in SA are noted. The reported improvements in service delivery and health outcomes\
  \ would not have been possible without the increasing political and financial commitment\
  \ of the South African government, and continued support from funding and implementing\
  \ partners.\r\n\r\n"
