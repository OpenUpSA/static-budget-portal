  \ The act provides the framework for relationships between the department and its\
  \ external clients. This includes the department\u2019s partnership with the South\
  \ African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee. The partnership is key to\
  \ improving South Africa\u2019s international ranking in selected sports. The act\
  \ also ensures that sport and physical activity contribute to social cohesion by\
  \ legislating on sports participation and sports infrastructure.\n\n"
