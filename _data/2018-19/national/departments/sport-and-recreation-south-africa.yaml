intro: "## Vote purpose\n\nTransform the delivery of sport and recreation by ensuring\
  \ equitable access, development and excellence at all levels of participation, thereby\
  \ improving social cohesion, nation building and the quality of life of all South\
  \ Africans.\n\n## Mandate\n\nThe Department of Sport and Recreation South Africa\
  \ is established in terms of the Public Service Act (1994). Its legal mandate is\
  \ derived from the National Sport and Recreation Act (1998), which requires it to\
  \ oversee the development and management of sport and recreation in South Africa.\
  \ The act provides the framework for relationships between the department and its\
  \ external clients. This includes the department\u2019s partnership with the South\
  \ African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee. The partnership is key to\
  \ improving South Africa\u2019s international ranking in selected sports. The act\
  \ also ensures that sport and physical activity contribute to social cohesion by\
  \ legislating on sports participation and sports infrastructure.\n\n"
