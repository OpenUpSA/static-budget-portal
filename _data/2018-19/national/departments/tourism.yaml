intro: '## Vote purpose


  Promote and support the growth and development of an equitable, competitive and
  sustainable tourism sector, enhancing its contribution to national priorities.


  ## Mandate


  The mandate of the Department of Tourism, as outlined in the Tourism Act (2014),
  is to promote the growth and development of the tourism sector; promote quality
  tourism products and services; provide for the effective domestic and international
  marketing of South Africa as a tourist destination; enhance cooperation and coordination
  between all spheres of government in developing and managing tourism; and promote
  the practice of responsible tourism for the benefit of South Africa and for the
  enjoyment of all its residents and foreign visitors.


  In recognition of tourism as a national priority with the potential to contribute
  significantly to economic development, the 1996 White Paper on the Development and
  Promotion of Tourism in South Africa provides for the promotion of domestic and
  international tourism. The national tourism sector strategy provides a blueprint
  for the sector to meet the growth targets contained in the National Development
  Plan (NDP).
