intro: '## Vote purpose


  Lead the provision of an integrated, sustainable, reliable and safe transport system
  through planning, developing, coordinating, promoting and implementing transport
  policies, regulations and strategies.


  ## Mandate


  The Constitution identifies the legislative responsibilities of different spheres
  of government with regards to airports and civil aviation, road infrastructure,
  rail transport, maritime transport, road traffic management and public transport.
  Transport is a function that is legislated and executed at the national, provincial
  and local government levels. The implementation of transport functions at the national
  level takes place through public entities that are overseen by the department, each
  with a specific delivery mandate, as specified in legislation establishing these
  entities.


  The 1996 White Paper on Transport defines the infrastructure and operations of rail,
  pipelines, roads, airports, harbours, and the intermodal operations of public transport
  and freight. The Department of Transport is responsible for the legislation and
  policies for all these sub-sectors. The department is therefore responsible for
  conducting sector research, formulating legislation and policy to set the strategic
  direction of sub-sectors, assigning responsibilities to public entities and other
  spheres of government, regulating through setting norms and standards, and monitoring
  implementation.
