  The Public Service Commission is an independent institution established in terms
  of chapter 10 of the Constitution. The commission derives its mandate from sections
  195 and 196 of the Constitution and is tasked and empowered, either of its own accord
  or if it receives any complaint, to investigate, monitor and evaluate the organisation
  and administration of the public service. The mandate also requires the commission
  to: evaluate the performance of government programmes and promote measures throughout
  the public service, which ensures effective and efficient performance within the
  public service; and promote the values and principles of public administration,
  as set out in the Constitution.
