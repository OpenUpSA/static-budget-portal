intro: "## Vote purpose\n\nEnsure protection against vulnerability by creating an\
  \ enabling environment for the provision of a comprehensive, integrated and sustainable\
  \ social development service. \n\n## Mandate\n\nThe Department of Social Development\
  \ is not established in terms of a single act. Several pieces of legislation determine\
  \ its mandate, many of which are under review. This includes the Social Assistance\
  \ Act (2004), which provides a legislative framework for providing social assistance.\
  \ The act sets out the different types of grants payable, as well as their qualifying\
  \ criteria. It also makes provision for the establishment of the inspectorate for\
  \ social assistance. Other pieces of legislation further define the department\u2019\
  s mandate:\n\n * the Non-Profit Organisations Act (1997) establishes an administrative\
  \ and regulatory framework within which non-profit organisations can conduct their\
  \ affairs, and provides for their registration by the department\n * the Older Persons\
  \ Act (2006) establishes a framework for empowering and protecting older persons,\
  \ and promoting and maintaining their status, rights, wellbeing, safety and security.\
  \ It provides for older persons to enjoy good quality services while staying with\
  \ their families in their communities for as long as possible. It also makes provision\
  \ for older persons to live in residential care facilities\n * the Children\u2019\
  s Act (2005) sets out principles relating to the care and protection of children,\
  \ and defines parental responsibilities and rights. It deals with early childhood\
  \ development (ECD), drop-in centres and early intervention, children in alternative\
  \ care such as foster care, child and youth care centres, and the adoption of children\n\
  \ * the Prevention of and Treatment for Substance Abuse Act (2008) regulates substance\
  \ abuse services and facilities\n * the 1998 White Paper on Population Policy for\
  \ South Africa is aimed at promoting the sustainable development of all South Africans\
  \ by integrating population issues with development planning in all spheres of government\
  \ and all sectors of society\n * the 2015 White Paper on the Rights of Persons with\
  \ Disabilities focuses on putting in place measures that will reduce the exclusion\
  \ and inequality experienced by persons with disabilities. This includes contributing\
  \ towards fighting poverty among persons with disabilities and their families, and\
  \ providing policy guidelines on building capacity in the public sector to deliver\
  \ equitable and accessible services\n * the 1997 White Paper for Social Welfare\
  \ sets out the principles, guidelines, policies and programmes for developmental\
  \ social welfare in South Africa. It provides the foundation for social welfare\
  \ in the post-1994 era\n * the Social Service Professions Act (1978) provides for\
