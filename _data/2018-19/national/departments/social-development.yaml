  \ Act (2004), which provides a legislative framework for providing social assistance.\
  \ The act sets out the different types of grants payable, as well as their qualifying\
  \ criteria. It also makes provision for the establishment of the inspectorate for\
  \ social assistance. Other pieces of legislation further define the department\u2019\
  s mandate:\n\n * the Non-Profit Organisations Act (1997) establishes an administrative\
  \ and regulatory framework within which non-profit organisations can conduct their\
  \ affairs, and provides for their registration by the department\n * the Older Persons\
