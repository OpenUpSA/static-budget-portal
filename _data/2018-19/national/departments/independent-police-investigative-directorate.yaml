intro: "## Vote purpose\n\nEnsure independent oversight of the South African Police\
  \ Service and the Municipal Police Services. Conduct independent and impartial investigations\
  \ of identified criminal offences allegedly committed by members of the South African\
  \ Police Service and the Municipal Police Services; and make appropriate recommendations.\n\
  \n## Mandate\n\nThe Independent Police Investigative Directorate exercises its functions\
  \ in accordance with the Independent Police Investigative Directorate Act (2011).\
  \ The act gives effect to the provisions of section 206(6) of the Constitution,\
  \ which provides for the establishment of an independent police complaints body\
  \ that must investigate any alleged misconduct of, or offence committed by, a member\
  \ of the police service. The thrust of the directorate\u2019s work is to investigate\
  \ serious and priority crimes allegedly committed by members of the South African\
  \ Police Service and Municipal Police Services.\n\nThe Independent Police Investigative\
  \ Directorate Act (2011), which came into effect on 1 April 2012, grants the directorate\
  \ an extended mandate and changes the focus of the directorate\u2019s work from\
  \ a complaints-driven organisation to one that prioritises the investigative function.\
  \ The act further places stringent obligations on the South African Police Service\
  \ and Municipal Police Services to report matters that must be investigated by the\
  \ directorate and ensure the implementation of resultant disciplinary recommendations\
  \ made by the directorate.\n\n\n"
