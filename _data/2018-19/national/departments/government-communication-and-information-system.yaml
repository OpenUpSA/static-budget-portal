  Provide a comprehensive communication service on behalf of government to facilitate

  and development, nation building, and reconciliation.

  with information that is timely, accurate and accessible. This is in support of
  the constitutional principles of freedom of expression, transparency and openness
  of government. The department is responsible for providing strategic leadership
  and coordinating government communication to ensure that the public are informed
  and have access to government programmes and policies that benefit them.
