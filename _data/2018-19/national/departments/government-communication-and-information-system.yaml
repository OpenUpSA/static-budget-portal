intro: '## Vote purpose


  Provide a comprehensive communication service on behalf of government to facilitate
  the involvement of the majority of South Africans in governance, reconstruction
  and development, nation building, and reconciliation.


  ## Mandate


  The mandate of the Government Communication and Information System is derived from
  section 195(g) of the Constitution, which stipulates that the public should be provided
  with information that is timely, accurate and accessible. This is in support of
  the constitutional principles of freedom of expression, transparency and openness
  of government. The department is responsible for providing strategic leadership
  and coordinating government communication to ensure that the public are informed
  and have access to government programmes and policies that benefit them.
