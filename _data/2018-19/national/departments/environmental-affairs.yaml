  \ development towards a better quality of life for all. \n\n## Mandate\n\nThe Department\
  \ of Environmental Affairs is mandated to give effect to the right of citizens to\
  \ an environment that is not harmful to their health or wellbeing, and to have the\
  \ environment protected for the benefit of present and future generations. To this\
  \ end, the department provides leadership in environmental management, conservation\
  \ and protection towards sustainability for the benefit of South Africans and the\
  \ global community.\n\nThis mandate is derived from the following legislation:\n\
  \n * the National Environmental Management Act (1998), which provides for specific\
  \ legislation on biodiversity and heritage resources; oceans and coasts; climate\
  \ change and air quality management; and waste and chemicals management\n * the\
  \ National Environmental Management Amendment Act (2004), which streamlines the\
  \ process of regulating and administering the environmental impact assessment process\n\
  \ * the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Amendment Act (2009),\
  \ which provides for the assignment of national parks, special parks and heritage\
  \ sites to South Africa in terms of the World Heritage Convention Act (1999)\n *\
  \ the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (2004), which significantly\
  \ reforms South Africa\u2019s laws regulating biodiversity\n * the National Environmental\
  \ Management: Air Quality and Atmospheric Act (2004), which reforms the law regulating\
  \ air quality in order to protect the environment by providing reasonable measures\
  \ for preventing pollution and ecological degradation, and securing ecologically\
  \ sustainable development; and provides for national norms and standards regulating\
  \ the monitoring of air quality\n * the National Environmental Management: Waste\
  \ Act (2008), which reforms the law regulating waste management in order to protect\
  \ health and the environment by providing reasonable measures for the prevention\
  \ of pollution\n * the National Environmental Management: Integrated Coastal Management\
  \ Act (2008), which promotes the conservation of the coastal environment and ensures\
  \ sustainable development practices and the use of natural resources.\n\n"
