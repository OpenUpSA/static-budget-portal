intro: "## Vote purpose\n\nProvide the support services required by Parliament to\
  \ fulfil its constitutional functions, assist political parties represented in Parliament\
  \ to secure administrative support and service constituents, and provide members\
  \ of Parliament with the necessary facilities.\n\n## Mandate\n\nThe mandate of Parliament\
  \ is based on the provisions of chapter 4 of the Constitution, which establishes\
  \ Parliament and sets out the functions it performs. Parliament is elected to represent\
  \ the people, ensure government by the people under the Constitution, and represent\
  \ the interests of provinces in the national sphere of government. Members of Parliament\
  \ elect the president, provide a national forum for the public consideration of\
  \ issues, pass legislation, and scrutinise and oversee executive action.\n\nParliament\u2019\
  s policy priorities set out long-term policy and outcomes. These are aligned with\
  \ the priorities and outcomes of the National Development Plan. To ensure that these\
  \ outcomes are met over feasible timeframes, 5-year, 10-year and 15-year milestones\
  \ have been set. The tabled strategic plan for the fifth Parliament is aimed at\
  \ implementing the first milestone.\n\n\n"
