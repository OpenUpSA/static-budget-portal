  \ department\u2019s portfolio of state-owned companies to unlock growth, drive industrialisation,\
  \ create jobs and develop skills. \n\n## Mandate\n\nThe Department of Public Enterprises\
  \ is government\u2019s shareholder representative for the state-owned companies\
  \ in its portfolio. The department\u2019s mandate is to fulfil oversight responsibilities\
  \ at these\nstate-owned companies to ensure that they contribute to the realisation\
  \ of government\u2019s strategic objectives, as articulated in the National Development\
  \ Plan (NDP), government\u2019s 2014-2019 medium-term strategic framework, the new\
  \ growth path and the industrial policy action plan. State-owned companies are crucial\
  \ to driving the state\u2019s strategic objectives of creating jobs, and enhancing\
  \ equity and transformation. The department does not directly execute programmes\
  \ but seeks to use state ownership in the economy to support the achievement of\
  \ these objectives.\n\n"
