intro: "## Vote purpose\n\nFormulate energy policies, regulatory frameworks and legislation,\
  \ and oversee their implementation, to ensure energy security, the promotion of\
  \ environmentally friendly energy carriers, and access to affordable and reliable\
  \ energy for all South Africans. \n\n## Mandate\n\nThe Department of Energy is mandated\
  \ to ensure the secure and sustainable provision of energy in support of socioeconomic\
  \ development. It aims to achieve this by developing an integrated energy plan for\
  \ the entire energy sector and regulating energy industries, and promoting investment\
  \ in accordance with the integrated resource plan for electricity. A number of acts\
  \ regulate the energy sector and reflect the legislative measures the department\
  \ has instituted to govern the sector. Key among these are:\n\n * the National Energy\
  \ Act (2008)\n * the Petroleum Products Act (1977)\n * the Electricity Regulation\
  \ Act (2006).\n\nThe National Energy Act (2008) sets out the core aspects of the\
  \ department\u2019s mandate and is the enabling legislation that empowers the Minister\
  \ of Energy to:\n\n * ensure that diverse energy resources are available in sustainable\
  \ quantities and at affordable prices in the South African economy to support economic\
  \ growth and poverty alleviation, while taking into account environmental considerations\n\
  \ * plan for the increased generation and consumption of renewable energy, a contingency\
  \ energy supply, the holding of strategic energy feedstock and carriers, adequate\
  \ investment in appropriate upkeep, and access to energy infrastructure\n * collect\
  \ data and information regarding energy demand, supply and generation\n * promote\
  \ electricity regulation, energy research and the efficient generation and consumption\
  \ of energy.\n\nThe department is also mandated to regulate the petroleum industry\
  \ at the manufacturing, wholesale and retail levels through the implementation of\
  \ the Petroleum Products Act (1977). The Petroleum and Liquid Fuels Charter is annexed\
  \ to the Petroleum Products Amendment Act (2003), and outlines the department\u2019\
  s strategy to effect transformation in the industry.\n\nIn terms of its policy mandate,\
  \ the department is working with a range of documents and legislation that support\
  \ the long-term vision for South Africa to use as much renewable energy as possible;\
  \ create the necessary conditions to stimulate an efficient electricity market;\
  \ and position South Africa to become globally competitive in the use of innovative\
  \ technology for the design, manufacture and deployment of state of the art nuclear\
  \ energy systems, power reactors and nuclear fuel cycle systems\n\n\n"
