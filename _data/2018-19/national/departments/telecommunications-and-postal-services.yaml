intro: '## Vote purpose


  Develop ICT policies and legislation that create favourable conditions for accelerated
  and shared sustainable economic growth that positively impacts on the wellbeing
  of all South Africans.


  ## Mandate


  The mandate of the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services is to develop
  ICT policies that will contribute to an inclusive information society. The department
  has a responsibility to modernise the economy and economic infrastructure through:
  facilitating the rollout of ICT infrastructure, applications and services; enabling
  the rollout of postal and banking services; developing e-strategies to roll out
  e-government and e-sectoral services; promoting cybersecurity and the security of
  networks; and promoting universal service and electronic communications in underserviced
  areas.


  The department also sets guidelines for the determinations of its regulatory authority,
  the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa, and oversees and strengthens
  the capacity of state-owned companies within its portfolio.


  The department derives its legislative mandate from the Electronic Communications
  Act (2005) and the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act (2002).
