intro: "## Vote purpose\n\nRealise the full potential of science and technology in\
  \ social and economic development by developing human resources, research and innovation.\
  \ \n\n## Mandate\n\nThe Department of Science and Technology derives its mandate\
  \ from the 1996 White Paper on Science and Technology, which introduced the concept\
  \ of the national system of innovation, a set of interacting organisa-tions and\
  \ policies through which the country creates, acquires, diffuses and puts into practice\
  \ new knowledge to help achieve individual and collective goals. A coordinated and\
  \ efficient national system of in-novation will help the country achieve its national\
  \ development priorities by promoting change through in-novation, enabling all South\
  \ Africans to enjoy the economic, sociopolitical and intellectual benefits of sci-ence,\
  \ technology and innovation.\n\n"
