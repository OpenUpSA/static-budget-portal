intro: "## Vote purpose\n\nPlay a significant role in reducing unemployment, poverty\
  \ and inequality by pursuing the objectives of decent work for all through: employment\
  \ creation and enterprise development; the setting of standards and protection of\
  \ rights at work, including the facilitation of equal opportunities and social dialogue;\
  \ and the provision of social protection.\n\n## Mandate\n\nThe Department of Labour\
  \ derives its legislative mandate from the Constitution, particularly the Bill of\
  \ Rights, which is given effect through a number of acts that regulate labour matters\
  \ in South Africa. The most important of these are the Labour Relations Act (1995),\
  \ the Basic Conditions of Employment Act (1997), the Employment Equity Act (1998),\
  \ the Occupational Health and Safety Act (1993), and the Employment Services Act\
  \ (2014).\n\nThe mandate of the department is to regulate the labour market through\
  \ policies and programmes developed in consultation with social partners. These\
  \ aim to:\n * improve economic efficiency and productivity\n * facilitate decent\
  \ employment creation\n * promote labour standards and fundamental rights at work\n\
  \ * provide adequate social safety nets to protect vulnerable workers\n * promote\
  \ and enforce sound labour relations\n * promote equity and eliminate unfair discrimination\
  \ in the workplace\n * eliminate inequality and discrimination in the workplace\n\
  \ * enhance occupational health and safety awareness and compliance in the workplace\n\
  \ * give value to social dialogue in the formulation of sound and responsive legislation\
  \ and policies to attain labour market flexibility for the competitiveness of enterprises,\
  \ balanced with the promotion of decent employment.\n\n\n"
