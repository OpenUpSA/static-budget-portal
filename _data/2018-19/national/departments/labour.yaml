  \ the Occupational Health and Safety Act (1993), and the Employment Services Act\
  \ (2014).\n\nThe mandate of the department is to regulate the labour market through\

  \ aim to:\n * improve economic efficiency and productivity\n * facilitate decent\
  \ employment creation\n * promote labour standards and fundamental rights at work\n\
