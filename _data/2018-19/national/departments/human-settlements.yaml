intro: '## Vote purpose


  Facilitate the creation of sustainable human settlements and the improvement to
  household quality of life.


  ## Mandate


  The Department of Human Settlements derives its core mandate and responsibilities
  from section 26 of the Constitution and section 3 of the Housing Act (1997), read
  in with conjunction approved policies and chapter 8 of the National Development
  Plan (NDP). This allows the department, in collaboration with provinces and municipalities,
  to establish and facilitate a sustainable national housing development process and
  related interventions. The department does this by: determining national policy
  and national norms and standards for housing and human settlements development;
  setting broad national housing delivery goals; providing funding to provinces and
  metropolitan cities; and monitoring the financial and non-financial performance
  of provinces and municipalities against these goals. In executing these roles and
  responsibilities, the department also builds capacity for provinces and municipalities;
  and promotes consultation with all stakeholders in the housing delivery chain, including
  other sector departments, civil society and the private sector.
