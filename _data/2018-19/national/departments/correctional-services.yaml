intro: '## Vote purpose


  Contribute to a just, peaceful and safer South Africa through the effective and
  humane incarceration of inmates and the rehabilitation and social reintegration
  of offenders.


  ## Mandate


  The mandate of the Department of Correctional Services is derived from the Correctional
  Services Act (1998), the Criminal Procedure Act (1977), the 2005 White Paper on
  Corrections, and the 2014 White Paper on Remand Detention Management in South Africa.
  The legislation requires the department to contribute to maintaining and promoting
  a just, peaceful and safe society by correcting offending behaviour in a safe, secure
  and humane environment, which allows for optimal rehabilitation and reduced repeat
  offending.
