intro: "## Vote purpose\n\n_Ensure independent oversight of the South African Police\
  \ Service and the\nMunicipal Police Services. Conduct independent and impartial\
  \ investigations of\nidentified criminal offences allegedly committed by members\
  \ of the South\nAfrican Police Service and the Municipal Police Services; and make\
  \ appropriate\nrecommendations._\n\n\n\n## Mandate\n\nThe Independent Police Investigative\
  \ Directorate exercises its functions in\naccordance with the Independent Police\
  \ Investigative Directorate Act\_(2011).\nThe act gives effect to the provisions\
  \ of section\_206(6) of the Constitution,\nwhich provides for the establishment\
  \ of an independent police complaints body\nthat must investigate any alleged misconduct\
  \ of, or offence committed by, a\nmember of the police service. The thrust of the\
  \ directorate\u2019s work is to\ninvestigate serious and priority crimes allegedly\
  \ committed by members of the\nSouth African Police Service and Municipal Police\
  \ Services.\n\nThe Independent Police Investigative Directorate Act\_(2011), which\
  \ came into\neffect on 1 April 2012, grants the directorate an extended mandate\
  \ and changes\nthe focus of the directorate\u2019s work from a complaints driven\
  \ organisation to\none that prioritises the investigative function. The act further\
  \ places\nstringent obligations on the South African Police Service and Municipal\
  \ Police\nServices to report matters that must be investigated by the directorate\
  \ and\nensures the implementation of disciplinary recommendations made by the\n\
  directorate.\n\n"
