intro: "## Vote purpose\n\n_Lead the provision of an integrated, sustainable, reliable\
  \ and safe transport\nsystem through planning, developing, coordinating, promoting\
  \ and implementing\ntransport policies, regulations and strategies._\n\n\n\n## Mandate\n\
  \nThe Constitution identifies the legislative responsibilities of different\nspheres\
  \ of government with regard to airports, roads, traffic management and\npublic transport.\
  \ Transport is a function that is legislated and executed at\nthe national, provincial\
  \ and local spheres of government. The implementation\nof transport functions at\
  \ the national sphere takes place through public\nentities that are overseen by\
  \ the department, which are discussed at the end\nof the chapter.\n\n  \n\nThe 1996\
  \ White Paper on Transport defines the different sub-sectors in the\ntransport sector.\
  \ Broadly, these are the infrastructure and operations of\nrail, pipelines, roads,\
  \ airports, harbours and the intermodal operations of\npublic transport and freight.\
  \ The Department of Transport is responsible for\nthe legislation and policies for\
  \ all these sub-sectors.\n\nFor the intermodal functions of public transport and\
  \ freight, the guiding\ndocuments are the National Land Transport Act\_(2009), the\
  \ public transport\nstrategy and the national freight logistics strategy.\n\nThe\
  \ department is therefore responsible for conducting sector research,\nformulating\
  \ legislation and policy to set the strategic direction of sub-\nsectors, assigning\
  \ responsibilities to public entities and other spheres of\ngovernment, regulating\
  \ the sector through setting norms and standards, and\nmonitoring implementation.\n\
