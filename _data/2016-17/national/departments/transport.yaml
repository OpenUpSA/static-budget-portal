  mandate:
    content: "The Constitution identifies the legislative responsibilities of different\n\
      spheres of government with regard to airports, roads, traffic management and\n\
      public transport. Transport is a function that is legislated and executed at\n\
      the national, provincial and local spheres of government. The implementation\n\
      of transport functions at the national sphere takes place through public\nentities\
      \ that are overseen by the department, which are discussed at the end\nof the\
      \ chapter.\n\n  \n\nThe 1996 White Paper on Transport defines the different\
      \ sub-sectors in the\ntransport sector. Broadly, these are the infrastructure\
      \ and operations of\nrail, pipelines, roads, airports, harbours and the intermodal\
      \ operations of\npublic transport and freight. The Department of Transport is\
      \ responsible for\nthe legislation and policies for all these sub-sectors.\n\
      \nFor the intermodal functions of public transport and freight, the guiding\n\
      documents are the National Land Transport Act\_(2009), the public transport\n\
      strategy and the national freight logistics strategy.\n\nThe department is therefore\
      \ responsible for conducting sector research,\nformulating legislation and policy\
      \ to set the strategic direction of sub-\nsectors, assigning responsibilities\
      \ to public entities and other spheres of\ngovernment, regulating the sector\
      \ through setting norms and standards, and\nmonitoring implementation.\n\n"
