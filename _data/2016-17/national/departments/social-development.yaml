intro: "## Vote purpose\n\n_Ensure protection against vulnerability by creating an\
  \ enabling environment\nfor the provision of a comprehensive, integrated and sustainable\
  \ social\ndevelopment service._\n\n\n\n## Mandate\n\nThe 1997\_White Paper for Social\
  \ Welfare sets out the principles, guidelines,\npolicies and programmes for developmental\
  \ social welfare in South Africa. It\nhas provided the foundation for social welfare\
  \ in the post-\_1994 era. The\nDepartment of Social Development is not established\
  \ in terms of a single act;\nseveral pieces of legislation determine its mandate:\n\
  \n  * The Social Assistance Act\_(2004) provides a legislative framework for providing\
  \ social assistance. It sets out the different types of grants payable as well as\
  \ their qualifying criteria. It also makes provision for the establishment of the\
  \ inspectorate for social assistance.\n\n  * The Non-Profit Organisations Act\_\
  (1997) establishes an administrative and regulatory framework within which non-profit\
  \ organisations can conduct their affairs, and provides for their registration by\
  \ the department.\n\n  * The Older Persons Act\_(2006) establishes a framework for\
  \ empowering and protecting older persons, and promoting and maintaining their status,\
  \ rights, wellbeing, safety and security. It provides for older persons to enjoy\
  \ good quality services while staying with their families in their communities for\
  \ as long as possible. It also makes provision for older persons to live in residential\
  \ care facilities if they are unable to stay with their families or within their\
  \ communities. \n\n  * The Children\u2019s Act\_(2005) sets out principles relating\
  \ to the care and protection of children, and defines parental responsibilities\
  \ and rights. It deals with early childhood development, drop-in centres and early\
  \ intervention, children in alternative care such as foster care, child and youth\
  \ care centres and the adoption of children. \n\n  * The Prevention of and Treatment\
  \ for Substance Abuse Act\_(2008) regulates substance abuse services and facilities.\
  \ \n\n  * The 1998\_White Paper on Population Policy for South Africa is aimed at\
  \ promoting the sustainable development of all South Africans by integrating population\
  \ issues with development planning in all spheres of government and all sectors\
  \ of society. \n\n"
