  mandate:
    content: "The Department of Energy is mandated to ensure the secure and sustainable\n\
      provision of energy for socioeconomic development. It is to achieve this by\n\
      developing an integrated energy plan for the entire energy sector, regulating\n\
      energy industries, and promoting investment in accordance with the integrated\n\
      resource plan (which focuses on electricity). A number of acts regulate the\n\
      energy sector and reflect the legislative measures the department has\ninstituted\
      \ to govern the energy sector.\n\n  * Key among these are:\n\n  * the National\
      \ Energy Act\_(2008)\n\n  * the Petroleum Products Act\_(1977)\n\n  * the Electricity\
      \ Regulation Act\_(2006).\n\n  * The National Energy Act\_(2008) sets out the\
      \ core aspects of the department\u2019s mandate and is the enabling legislation\
      \ that empowers the Minister of Energy to:\n\n  * ensure that diverse energy\
      \ resources are available in sustainable quantities and at affordable prices\
      \ in the South African economy to support economic growth and poverty alleviation,\
      \ while taking into account environmental considerations\n\n  * plan for the\
      \ increased generation and consumption of renewable energy, a contingency energy\
      \ supply, the holding of strategic energy feedstock and carriers, adequate investment\
      \ in appropriate upkeep, and access to energy infrastructure\n\n  * collect\
      \ data and information regarding energy demand, supply and generation\n\n  *\
      \ promote electricity regulation, energy research and the efficient generation\
      \ and consumption of energy.\n\nThe department is also mandated to regulate\
      \ the petroleum industry at the\nmanufacturing, wholesale and retail levels,\
      \ through the implementation of the\nPetroleum Products Act\_(1977). The Petroleum\
      \ and Liquid Fuels Charter is\nannexed to the Petroleum Products Amendment Act\_\
      (2003), and outlines the\ndepartment\u2019s strategy to effect the transformation\
      \ of the industry.\n\nIn terms of its policy mandate, the department is working\
      \ with a range of\ndocuments and legislation that support the long term vision\
      \ for South Africa\nto use as much renewable energy as possible; create the\
      \ necessary conditions\nto stimulate an efficient electricity market; and position\
      \ South Africa to\nbecome globally competitive in the use of innovative technology\
      \ for the\ndesign, manufacture and deployment of state of the art nuclear energy\
      \ systems,\npower reactors and nuclear fuel cycle systems.\n\n"
