intro: "## Vote purpose\n\n_Formulate energy policies, regulatory frameworks and legislation,\
  \ and oversee\ntheir implementation to ensure energy security, the promotion of\n\
  environmentally friendly energy carriers, and access to affordable and\nreliable\
  \ energy for all South Africans._\n\n\n\n## Mandate\n\nThe Department of Energy\
  \ is mandated to ensure the secure and sustainable\nprovision of energy for socioeconomic\
  \ development. It is to achieve this by\ndeveloping an integrated energy plan for\
  \ the entire energy sector, regulating\nenergy industries, and promoting investment\
  \ in accordance with the integrated\nresource plan (which focuses on electricity).\
  \ A number of acts regulate the\nenergy sector and reflect the legislative measures\
  \ the department has\ninstituted to govern the energy sector.\n\n  * Key among these\
  \ are:\n\n  * the National Energy Act\_(2008)\n\n  * the Petroleum Products Act\_\
  (1977)\n\n  * the Electricity Regulation Act\_(2006).\n\n  * The National Energy\
  \ Act\_(2008) sets out the core aspects of the department\u2019s mandate and is\
  \ the enabling legislation that empowers the Minister of Energy to:\n\n  * ensure\
  \ that diverse energy resources are available in sustainable quantities and at affordable\
  \ prices in the South African economy to support economic growth and poverty alleviation,\
  \ while taking into account environmental considerations\n\n  * plan for the increased\
  \ generation and consumption of renewable energy, a contingency energy supply, the\
  \ holding of strategic energy feedstock and carriers, adequate investment in appropriate\
  \ upkeep, and access to energy infrastructure\n\n  * collect data and information\
  \ regarding energy demand, supply and generation\n\n  * promote electricity regulation,\
  \ energy research and the efficient generation and consumption of energy.\n\nThe\
  \ department is also mandated to regulate the petroleum industry at the\nmanufacturing,\
  \ wholesale and retail levels, through the implementation of the\nPetroleum Products\
  \ Act\_(1977). The Petroleum and Liquid Fuels Charter is\nannexed to the Petroleum\
  \ Products Amendment Act\_(2003), and outlines the\ndepartment\u2019s strategy to\
  \ effect the transformation of the industry.\n\nIn terms of its policy mandate,\
  \ the department is working with a range of\ndocuments and legislation that support\
  \ the long term vision for South Africa\nto use as much renewable energy as possible;\
  \ create the necessary conditions\nto stimulate an efficient electricity market;\
  \ and position South Africa to\nbecome globally competitive in the use of innovative\
  \ technology for the\ndesign, manufacture and deployment of state of the art nuclear\
  \ energy systems,\npower reactors and nuclear fuel cycle systems.\n\n"
