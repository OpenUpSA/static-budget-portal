      \ rights in and the disposal of common property; the establishment of bodies\

      \ management and spatial planning systems; the development of government facilities\
      \ such as hospitals, clinics and schools; and rural development plans, guidelines,\
      \ and norms and standards.\n\n  * The department is also mandated to initiate,\
      \ facilitate, coordinate, catalyse and implement an integrated rural development\
      \ programme, which is linked to the need to create vibrant, equitable and sustainable\
      \ rural communities (outcome 7 of government\u2019s 2014-2019 medium term strategic\
      \ framework). \n\n"
