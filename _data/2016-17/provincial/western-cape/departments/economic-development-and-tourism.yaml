intro: "## Vision\r\n\r\nThe Department\u2019s vision is a Western Cape that has a\
  \ vibrant, innovative, and sustainable economy,\r\ncharacterised by growth, employment\
  \ and increasing equity, and built on the full potential of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
  ## Mission\r\n\r\n* To achieve the vision statement as noted above, the Department\
  \ of Economic Development and\r\n\r\n* Tourism will provide leadership to the Western\
  \ Cape economy through the Department\u2019s\r\nunderstanding of the economy, its\
  \ ability to identify economic opportunities and potential, and its\r\ncontribution\
  \ to government economic priorities.\r\n\r\n*The Department will also act as a catalyst\
  \ for the transformation of the economy and respond to the\r\nchallenges and opportunities\
  \ of its economic citizens, in order to support the government\u2019s goal of\r\n\
  creation of opportunities for businesses and citizens to grow the economy and employment.\r\
  \n\r\nLastly, it will contribute to the provision of a predictable, competitive,\
  \ equitable and responsible\r\nenvironment for investment, enterprise and trade.\r\
  \n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Main Services and Core functions\r\n\r\nWith the adoption of Strategic\
  \ Goal 1: Create opportunities for growth and jobs and its subsequent\r\nStrategic\
  \ directive, the primary focus for Vote 12: Economic Development and Tourism is\
  \ squarely placed on\r\ndelivering effectively on the provision of an enabling business\
  \ environment which will allow for the private\r\nsector to grow the economy and\
  \ create jobs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there is a national drive and commitment to create\
  \ jobs. This is demonstrated by the numerous\r\nincentives associated with National\
  \ Government\u2019s approach to economic stimulation policies, where the\r\nemphasis\
  \ has been placed on the creation of \u201Creal work opportunities\u201D.\r\n\r\n\
  In this context, this Department, has emphasised a strategic approach that will\
  \ be grounded in the need to:\r\n\r\n* Create opportunities for growth;\r\n\r\n\
  * Increase work opportunities for all citizens;\r\n\r\n* Creating an enabling environment\
  \ for business and citizenry growth and development; and\r\n\r\n* Creating a competitive\
  \ and productive economic Province."
