  \ cost-effective package of health services to the\r\npeople of the Western Cape.\
  \ This includes preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative\r\
  \ncare, via:\r\n\r\n* District health services including: home and community-based\
  \ care, clinics, community day/health\r\ncentres and district hospitals.\r\n\r\n\
