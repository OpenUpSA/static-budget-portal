  \ providing health services to the population of\r\nthe Province, approximately\
  \ 6.2 million of which 75 per cent is estimated to be uninsured. Tertiary hospitals\r\

  \ Tertiary Services Grant.\r\nThe Department will continue to provide a comprehensive,\
  \ cost-effective package of health services to the\r\npeople of the Western Cape.\
  \ This includes preventive, promotive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative\r\
  \ncare, via:\r\n\r\n* District health services including: home and community-based\
  \ care, clinics, community day/health\r\ncentres and district hospitals.\r\n\r\n\
  * Provincial, central and specialised hospital services, which include hospitals\
  \ such as Tuberculosis,\r\nPsychiatric and Rehabilitation hospitals.\r\n\r\n* Emergency\
