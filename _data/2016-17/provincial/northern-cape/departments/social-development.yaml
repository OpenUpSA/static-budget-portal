  \ provision of integrated social development services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n## Core functions\n\
  \nDepartment of Social Development has the responsibility of leading in partnership\
  \ with stakeholders, outcome 13 by building an inclusive and responsive social protection\
  \ system. As prescribed in the long term vision of the National Development Plan\
  \ (NDP) 2030, the social protection system has the ability to assist families to\
  \ achieve the basic standard of living and make sure that no-one slip below the\
  \ minimum standard of living.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the department has identified\
  \ in accordance with the NDP 2030 a targeted number of 13 334 zero income households\
  \ to be migrated out of poverty over the next five years. The services provided\
  \ by the department are statutory services, counseling services, therapeutic services\
  \ and programmes, treatment services, after care services, institutionalized services\
  \ such as support groups with children and parents.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe implementation\
  \ and outcome of the service delivery goals are guided by the mandate of the Department\
  \ namely:\r\n\r\n* To build an inclusive and responsive social protection system.\r\
  \n\r\n* To reform social welfare services as outlined in the Medium Term Strategic\
  \ Framework 2014-2019 ,\r\n\r\n* To provide access to quality Early Childhood Development\
  \ (ECD) services and strengthen community development interventions as the three\
  \ sub-outcomes to be achieved through expanding service provision to the vulnerable\
  \ groups, whilst creating support networks through service provision to respond\
  \ to the needs of each vulnerable group e.g. people with disabilities, older persons,\
  \ zero income families or children living and working on the street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\
  The nature of the services rendered by the Department of Social Development in complementing\
  \ partnership with stakeholders to various vulnerable groups, requires a service\
  \ delivery methodology that advocate for teamwork amongst the range of social service\
  \ professionals within a community to create therapeutic support networks at family\
  \ level, social protection support networks at soup kitchen, Drop-\r\n\r\nin- centre\
  \ , community level and developmental support networks at Youth Service Centre level\
  \ for the youth."
