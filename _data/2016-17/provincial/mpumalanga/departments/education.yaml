intro: "## Vision\n\nAdvancing excellence in quality education provision\r\n\r\n\n\
  \n## Mission\n\nThe Mpumalanga Department of Education commits to work with its\
  \ stakeholders to\r\npromote effective teaching and learning through good governance,\
  \ capable management\r\nand proficient leadership\r\n\r\n\n\n## Core functions and\
  \ responsibilities\n\n* Since 2001, the department has been shifting its focus from\
  \ establishing broad policy and\r\ngovernance structures and stabilisation of the\
  \ education system, to improving access,\r\nquality and equity. Recent policy pronouncements\
  \ from the Presidential State of the\r\nNation Address point to the centrality of\
  \ Education in driving an accelerated and shared\r\neconomic growth. 2015/2016 financial\
  \ year was the beginning of a new 5 Year Cycle\r\n2015 \u2013 2020 whereby the focus\
  \ will be on implementing the National Development Plan\r\nthrough the priorities\
  \ as outlined Medium Term Strategic Framework 2014 -2019 of\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\
  \n* In order to achieve the outcome of improved quality of basic education, there\
  \ will be a\r\nfocus on improving the quality of teaching so that results improve,\
  \ as measured by\r\ninternationally benchmarked tests. Targets have been set for\
  \ the improvements in results\r\nat various grades over time. In order to achieve\
  \ this, we will be providing all schools with\r\nappropriate learner and teacher\
  \ support materials such as lesson plans, workbooks and\r\ntextbooks, to ensure\
  \ proper coverage of the curriculum. Curriculum coverage and the\r\nutilisation\
  \ of these resources will be closely monitored as this is part of the nonnegotiables\r\
  \nfor the sector. The monitoring of the implementation of the Curriculum and\r\n\
  Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS) in both General Education Training (GET) and\r\
  \nFurther Education Training (FET) phases of the system will be prioritised. Some\
  \ children\r\nlive far away from school. Others need special education and local\
  \ schools may not offer\r\nthis, and many are from poor homes. To achieve this we\
  \ will continue to make the\r\nnumber of no-fee schools available and to increase\
  \ feeding schemes to assist children\r\nfrom poor families."
