  \ (ECPL) is facilitating law making; ensuring public participaton in the legislative\
  \ processes; and exercising oversight over Executive and other organs of the state.\
  \ ECPL is also responsible for furthering cooperative governance between provincial\
  \ and local legislative institutions.\r\n\r\nThe oversight function and the opening\
  \ oof the doors of the Legislature to the public continue to be important areas\
  \ of the Legislature's activities. Bills brought before the Legislature by departments\
  \ are scrutinized before they are taled in the HOuse for debate. In this process,\
  \ the stakeholder's views are taken into account-either by invitingthem to the Legislature\
  \ or by holding meetings. These inputs are also prepared in respect of national\
  \ legislation through the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). The Legislature\
  \ also ensures that departments spend voted funds in the prescribed manner through\
  \ the oversight function provided by portfolio comittees."
