- content: "The core mandate of the Eastern Cape Provincial legislature (ECPL) is\
    \ facilitating law making; ensuring public participaton in the legislative processes;\
    \ and exercising oversight over Executive and other organs of the state. ECPL\
    \ is also responsible for furthering cooperative governance between provincial\
    \ and local legislative institutions.\r\n\r\nThe oversight function and the opening\
    \ oof the doors of the Legislature to the public continue to be important areas\
    \ of the Legislature's activities. Bills brought before the Legislature by departments\
    \ are scrutinized before they are taled in the HOuse for debate. In this process,\
    \ the stakeholder's views are taken into account-either by invitingthem to the\
    \ Legislature or by holding meetings. These inputs are also prepared in respect\
    \ of national legislation through the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). The\
    \ Legislature also ensures that departments spend voted funds in the prescribed\
    \ manner through the oversight function provided by portfolio comittees."
