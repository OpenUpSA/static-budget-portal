  \ oof the doors of the Legislature to the public continue to be important areas\
  \ of the Legislature's activities. Bills brought before the Legislature by departments\
  \ are scrutinized before they are taled in the HOuse for debate. In this process,\
  \ the stakeholder's views are taken into account-either by invitingthem to the Legislature\
  \ or by holding meetings. These inputs are also prepared in respect of national\
  \ legislation through the National Council of Provinces (NCOP). The Legislature\
  \ also ensures that departments spend voted funds in the prescribed manner through\
  \ the oversight function provided by portfolio comittees."
