intro: "## Vision\n\nAdvancing excellence in quality education provision\r\n\r\n\n\
  \n## Mission\n\nThe Mpumalanga Department of Education commits to work with its\
  \ stakeholders to promote\r\neffective teaching and learning through good governance,\
  \ capable management and\r\nproficient leadership\r\n\r\n\n\n## Core functions\n\
  \nSince 2001, the department has been shifting its focus from establishing broad\
  \ policy and\r\ngovernance structures and stabilisation of the education system,\
  \ to improving access, quality\r\nand equity. Recent policy pronouncements from\
  \ the Presidential State of the Nation Address\r\npoint to the centrality of Education\
  \ in driving an accelerated and shared economic growth.\r\n2015/2016 financial year\
  \ was the beginning of a new 5 Year Cycle 2015 \u2013 2020 whereby the\r\nfocus\
  \ will be on implementing the National Development Plan through the priorities as\r\
  \noutlined Medium Term Strategic Framework 2014 -2019 of Government. In order to\
  \ achieve\r\nthe outcome of improved quality of basic education, there will be a\
  \ focus on improving the\r\nquality of teaching so that results improve, as measured\
  \ by internationally benchmarked\r\ntests. Targets have been set for the improvements\
  \ in results at various grades over time. In\r\norder to achieve this, we will be\
  \ providing all schools with appropriate learner and teacher\r\nsupport materials\
  \ such as lesson plans, workbooks and textbooks, to ensure proper\r\ncoverage of\
  \ the curriculum. Curriculum coverage and the utilisation of these resources will\r\
  \nbe closely monitored as this is part of the non-negotiables for the sector.\r\n\
  The monitoring of the implementation of the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement\r\
  \n(CAPS) in both General Education Training (GET) and Further Education Training\
  \ (FET)\r\nphases of the system will be prioritised. Some children live far away\
  \ from school. Others\r\nneed special education and local schools may not offer\
  \ this, and many are from poor homes.\r\nTo achieve this we will continue to make\
  \ the number of no-fee schools available and to\r\nincrease feeding schemes to assist\
  \ children from poor families."
