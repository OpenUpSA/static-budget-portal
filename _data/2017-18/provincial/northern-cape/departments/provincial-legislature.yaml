intro: "## Vision\n\nAn activist Legislature advancing the aspirations of the people\
  \ of the Northern Cape.\r\n\r\n\n\n## Mission\n\nTo serve people of the Northern\
  \ Cape by building a developmental institution for effective law making, public\
  \ participation, accountability and oversight over the executive and municipalities\r\
  \n\r\n\n\n## Core Services\n\n*The Northern Cape Provincial Legislature (NCPL) exists\
  \ in terms of section 104 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act\
  \ 108 of 1996 which vests the legislative authority of the Northern Cape Province\
  \ in the NCPL. In addition to the legislative authority, Provincial Legislature\
  \ also has a constitutional mandate of oversight over the provincial executive as\
  \ well as a responsibility to ensure public participation in its processes.\r\n\r\
  \n*An effective Legislature is strongly correlated with the existence of a viable\
  \ democracy and an open society. The Northern Cape Provincial Legislature on account\
  \ of its members and legislative functions can empower ordinary citizens to participate\
  \ in the development of policies that shape their lives. Due to its oversight role,\
  \ the NCPL is fundamental in establishing the rule of law, protecting human rights,\
  \ overseeing transparent governance processes and ensuring compliance with national\
  \ and provincial legislation in the Northern Cape.\r\n\r\n*These functions, though\
  \ universally recognised are not always naturally or effectively implemented without\
  \ sufficient human and financial resources. With its budget the NCPL is able to\
  \ develop programmes geared at its own development. These programmes are aimed at\
  \ strengthening representatives, transparency, accountability and effective government"
