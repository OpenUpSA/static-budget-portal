  \nDepartment of Social Development (DSD) has the responsibility of leading in partnership\
  \ with stakeholder\u2019s outcome 13, by building an inclusive and responsive social\
  \ protection system. As prescribed in the long-term vision of the National Development\
  \ Plan (NDP) 2030, the social protection system has the ability to assist families\
  \ to achieve the basic standard of living and making sure that no one slips below\
  \ the minimum standard of living.\r\nIn this regard, the department has identified\
  \ in accordance with the NDP 2030 a targeted number of 13 334 zero income households\
  \ to be migrated out of poverty over the next five years. The services provided\
  \ by the department are statutory services, counseling services, therapeutic services,\
  \ treatment services, after care services and institutionalized services such as\
  \ support groups with children and parents.\r\n\r\nThe implementation and outcome\
  \ of the service delivery goals are guided by the mandate of the department namely:\r\
  \n\r\n* To build an inclusive and responsive social protection system.\r\n\r\n*\
  \ To reform social welfare services as outlined in the Medium Term Strategic Framework\
  \ 2014-2019,\r\n\r\n* To provide access to quality Early Childhood Development (ECD)\
  \ services and strengthen community development interventions as the three sub-outcomes\
  \ to be achieved through expanding service provision to the vulnerable groups, whilst\
  \ creating support networks through service provision to respond to the needs of\
  \ each vulnerable group e.g. people with disabilities, older persons, zero income\
  \ families or children living and working on the street.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the\
  \ services rendered by the Department of Social Development in complementing partnership\
  \ with stakeholders to various vulnerable groups, requires a service delivery methodology\
  \ that advocate for teamwork amongst the range of social service professionals within\
  \ a community to create therapeutic support networks at family level, social protection\
  \ support networks at soup kitchen, Drop-in- Centre at community level and developmental\
  \ support networks at Youth Service Centre level for the youth.\r\n"
