It also provides for the acquisition, maintenance, planning, development, improvement and disposal of property and the provision of financial assistance for land reform purposes.\n\n- The Communal Property Associations Act (1996), which enables communities to form juristic persons, to be known as communal property associations, in order to acquire, hold and manage property on a basis agreed to by members of a community in terms of a written constitution.\n"
