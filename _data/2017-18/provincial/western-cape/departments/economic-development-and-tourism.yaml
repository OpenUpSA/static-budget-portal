  ## Mission\r\n\r\nTo achieve the vision statement as noted above, the Department\
  \ of Economic Development and Tourism\r\nwill provide qualitative leadership to\
  \ the Western Cape economy through the Department\u2019s understanding\r\nof the\
  \ economy, its ability to identify economic opportunities and potential, and its\
  \ contribution to\r\ngovernment economic priorities.\r\n\r\nThe Department will\
  \ also act as a catalyst for the transformation of the economy and respond to the\r\
  \nchallenges and opportunities of its economic citizens, in order to support the\
  \ government\u2019s goal of creation\r\nof opportunities for businesses and citizens\
  \ to grow the economy and employment.\r\n\r\nLastly, it will contribute to the provision\
  \ of a predictable, competitive, equitable and responsible\r\nenvironment for investment,\
  \ enterprise and trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Main Services and Core functions\r\
  \n\r\nWith the adoption of Strategic Goal 1: Create opportunities for growth and\
  \ jobs and its subsequent\r\nStrategic directive, the primary focus for Vote 12:\
  \ Economic Development and Tourism is squarely placed on\r\ndelivering effectively\
  \ on the provision of an enabling business environment which will allow for the\
  \ private\r\nsector to grow the economy and create jobs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there\
  \ is a national drive and commitment to create jobs. This is demonstrated by the\
  \ numerous\r\nincentives associated with National Government\u2019s approach to\
  \ economic stimulation policies, where the\r\nemphasis has been placed on the creation\
  \ of \u201Creal work opportunities\u201D.\r\n\r\nIn this context, this Department,\
  \ has emphasised a strategic approach that will be grounded in the need to:\r\n\r\
  \n* Create opportunities for growth;\r\n\r\n* Increase work opportunities for all\
  \ citizens;\r\n\r\n* Creating an enabling environment for business and citizenry\
