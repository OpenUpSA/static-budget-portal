intro: "Tools and methods used for formulating and\
  analysing government budgeting for the progressive\
  realisation of socio-economic rights\n\nThe progressive realisation of social and economic rights is central to the transformation of our society. The persistence of systemic poverty and inequality in South Africa has shown that unless the realisation of socio-economic rights (SERs) promised in the Constitution is monitored and tracked over time, their inclusion on paper might not be felt in reality by millions of poor people."
methodology: "The development of this Guide was informed by a variety of actors and perspectives, including \npolicy-makers   involved   in   SER   budget   decision-making   processes,   and   researchers   and   \norganisations that monitor the advancement of SER in South Africa. A Roundtable discussion, \nhosted by SPII and the SAHRC, brought together these various actors to discuss:\nhow  the  government  budget  is  formulated  and  implemented  in  a  manner  that  either  advances,  \nor inhibits, the progressive realisation of socio-economic rights, within – and to the maximum of – \navailable resources.\nPresentations were made by representatives of the National Treasury, Open Democracy Advice \nCentre,  Socio-Economic  Rights  Institute,  Black  Sash,  Social  Justice  Coalition,  Equal  Education  \nand the Public Service Accountability Monitor.\nThe  Roundtable  unpacked  the  conceptual  challenges  and  opportunities  of  engaging  in  SER  \nbudget  work;  how  the  South  African  Constitution  informs  budget  prioritisation,  formulation  \nand implementation; the availability of data that is transparent and accessible; and the practical \nimplications of monitoring the advancement of SER through budget analysis."
