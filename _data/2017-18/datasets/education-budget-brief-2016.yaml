intro: "The  South  African  Constitution\r\n  commits  government  departments  to\
  \  the  progressive  realisation  of  \r\nvarious socio\r\n-economic rights within\
  \ available resources. These rights include the right to education, \r\nhealthcare,\
  \ housing and social welfare.\r\n1\r\n The PSAM defines social accountability as\
  \ the obligation by \r\npublic officials and private service providers to justify\
  \ their performance in progressively addressing \r\nthe  above  rights  via  the\
  \  provision  of  effective  public  services.  In  order  to  effectively  realise\
  \  these  \r\nrights  through  the  delivery  of  publ\r\nic  services,  state \
  \ departments  and  private  service  providers  \r\nresponsible  for  the  management\
  \  of  public  resources  must  implement  effective  accountability  and  \r\n\
  service  delivery  systems.  These  include:  planning  and  resource  allocation\
  \  systems;  expenditure  \r\nmanag\r\nement  systems;  performance  monitoring\
  \  systems;  integrity  systems;  and  oversight  systems.  \r\nThe  effectiveness\
  \  of  these  systems  can  be  established  by  monitoring  their  information\
  \  outputs.  To  \r\nevaluate  these  systems,  the  PSAM  has  developed  a  set\
  \  of  evidence-\r\nbase\r\nd  tools  for  monitoring  the  \r\ninformation produced\
  \ annually by each system.\r\nThe  South  Africa  g\r\novernment \r\nhas  committed\r\
  \n  to  ensur\r\ning \r\nthat \r\nit  addresses  the  most  pressing  social  \r\
  \nand  economic  needs  of  those  i\r\nt  serve\r\nthrough  the  prioritisation\
  \  of  public  resources  within  the  \r\nannual \r\nbudget.  This  budget  brief\r\
  \n  analyses \r\nthe \r\nEastern\r\n  Cape  Department  of  Education\u2019s  ability\
  \  to  \r\nimplement effective and efficient \r\ninfrastructure\r\n delivery systems\
  \ in 2016 as well\r\n as into the 2016/17 \r\nMedium Term Expenditure Framework\r\
