intro: Dilapidated public school infrastructure can be found across the country, but
  the problem is particularly acute in the Eastern Cape where the majority of the
  so called 'mud schools' are located. On 04 February 2011, following court action
  on the issue of mud schools, the Legal Resources Centre, acting on behalf of 7 schools
  and the Centre for Child Law, concluded a landmark settlement with the National
  Department of Basic Education in which the Department committed to spend R8.2 billion
  from 1 April 2011 to 1 March 2014 to eradicate mud schools and improve infrastructure
  of schools throughout South Africa. The Centre for Child Law commissioned Cornerstone
  Economic Research, to track school infrastructure spending and delivery. The aim
  of the research was to assess what progress has been made in addressing the issues
  that brought about the litigation. This study, amongst other things, makes the concerning
  finding that the Department has woefully underspent the allocated school infrastructure
  funding for two years running. The target for the number of schools to be built
  in 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 was 49. However, only 10 schools had been completed at
  the end of the first year.
