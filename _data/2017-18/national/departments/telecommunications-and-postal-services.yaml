intro: "## Vote purpose\n\n_Develop information and communication technology (ICT)\
  \ policies and\nlegislation that create favourable conditions for accelerated and\
  \ shared\nsustainable economic growth that positively impacts on the wellbeing of\
  \ all\nSouth Africans._\n\n\n\n## Mandate\n\nThe Department of Telecommunications\
  \ and Postal Services is mandated to\ndevelop ICT policies and to ensure the development\
  \ of robust, reliable, secure\nand affordable ICT infrastructure. This contributes\
  \ to the development of an\ninclusive information society in which information and\
  \ ICT tools are key\ndrivers of accelerated and sustained shared economic growth\
  \ and societal\ndevelopment. The Electronic Communications Act\_(2005) allows the\
  \ Minister of\nTelecommunications and Postal Services to draft policies to fulfil\
  \ South\nAfrica\u2019s obligations under bilateral, multilateral, and international\
  \ treaties\nand conventions; set guidelines for the determination of certain licence\
  \ fees\nby the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa; and promote\n\
  universal service and electronic communications services in underserviced\nareas.\
  \ The act also allows the minister to promote the participation of small\nbusinesses\
  \ in the ICT sector, and oversee and strengthen the capacity of\nstate-owned enterprises.\
  \ The department also contributes to building an ICT\nskills base in the country\
  \ to ensure equitable prosperity and global\ncompetitiveness.\n\nIn addition to\
  \ the Electronic Communications Act (2005), the department\u2019s\nmandate is derived\
  \ from the following legislation:\n\n  * the Electronic Communications and Transactions\
  \ Act (2002)\n\n  * the Sentech Act (1996)\n\n  * the Postal Services Act (1998)\n\
  \n  * the South Africa Post Office SOC Ltd Act (2011)\n\n  * the South African Postbank\
  \ Limited Act (2010)\n\n  * the State Information Technology Agency Act (1998)\n\
  \n  * the Broadband Infraco Act (2007).\n\n"
