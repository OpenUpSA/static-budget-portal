  \ fees\nby the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa; and promote\n\
  universal service and electronic communications services in underserviced\nareas.\
  \ The act also allows the minister to promote the participation of small\nbusinesses\
  \ in the ICT sector, and oversee and strengthen the capacity of\nstate-owned enterprises.\
  \ The department also contributes to building an ICT\nskills base in the country\
  \ to ensure equitable prosperity and global\ncompetitiveness.\n\nIn addition to\
  \ the Electronic Communications Act (2005), the department\u2019s\nmandate is derived\
  \ from the following legislation:\n\n  * the Electronic Communications and Transactions\
