  mandate:
    content: "The Department of Social Development is not established in terms of\
      \ a single\nact. Several pieces of legislation determine its mandate, including\
      \ the Social\nAssistance Act (2004), which provides a legislative framework\
      \ for providing\nsocial assistance. The act sets out the different types of\
      \ grants payable, as\nwell as their qualifying criteria. It also makes provision\
      \ for the\nestablishment of the inspectorate for social assistance. Other pieces\
      \ of\nlegislation further define the department\u2019s mandate:\n\n  * The Non-Profit\
      \ Organisations Act (1997) establishes an administrative and regulatory framework\
      \ within which non-profit organisations can conduct their affairs, and provides\
      \ for their registration by the department. \n\n  * The Older Persons Act (2006)\
      \ establishes a framework for empowering and protecting older persons, and promoting\
      \ and maintaining their status, rights, wellbeing, safety and security. It provides\
      \ for older persons to enjoy good quality services while staying with their\
      \ families in their communities for as long as possible. It also makes provision\
      \ for older persons to live in residential care facilities. \n\n  * The Children\u2019\
      s Act (2005) sets out principles relating to the care and protection of children,\
      \ and defines parental responsibilities and rights. It deals with early childhood\
      \ development (ECD), drop-in centres and early intervention, children in alternative\
      \ care such as foster care, child and youth care centres and the adoption of\
      \ children. The national ECD policy aims to define the provision of equitable\
      \ ECD services in South Africa. \n\n  * The Prevention of and Treatment for\
      \ Substance Abuse Act (2008) regulates substance abuse services and facilities.\
      \ \n\n  * The 1998 White Paper on Population Policy for South Africa is aimed\
      \ at promoting the sustainable development of all South Africans by integrating\
      \ population issues with development planning in all spheres of government and\
      \ all sectors of society.\n\n  * The national disability rights policy deepens\
      \ the mainstreaming trajectory for realising the rights of persons with disabilities.\
      \ The policy does this through the development of targeted interventions that\
      \ apply the principles of universal design, and guide the review of existing\
      \ and development of new sectoral legislation and policies, programmes, budgets\
      \ and reporting systems to bring these in line with constitutional and international\
      \ treaty obligations. \n\n  * The 1997 White Paper for Social Welfare sets out\
      \ the principles, guidelines, policies and programmes for developmental social\
      \ welfare in South Africa. It provides the foundation for social welfare in\
      \ the post-1994 era.\n\n"
