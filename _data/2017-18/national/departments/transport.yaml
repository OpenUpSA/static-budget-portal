intro: '## Vote purpose


  _Lead the provision of an integrated, sustainable, reliable and safe transport

  system through planning, developing, coordinating, promoting and implementing

  transport policies, regulations and strategies._




  ## Mandate


  The Constitution identifies the legislative responsibilities of different

  spheres of government with regards to airports, road infrastructure, rail,

  maritime, road traffic management and public transport. Transport is a

  function that is legislated and executed at the national, provincial and local

  government levels. The implementation of transport functions at the national

  level takes place through public entities that are overseen by the department,

  each with a specific delivery mandate, as specified in legislation

  establishing these entities.


  The 1996 White Paper on Transport defines the infrastructure and operations of

  rail, pipelines, roads, airports, harbours, and the intermodal operations of

  public transport and freight. The Department of Transport is responsible for

  the legislation and policies for all these sub-sectors.


  The department is therefore responsible for conducting sector research,

  formulating legislation and policy to set the strategic direction of sub-

  sectors, assigning responsibilities to public entities and other spheres of

  government, regulating through setting norms and standards, and monitoring

  implementation.
