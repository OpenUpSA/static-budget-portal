intro: "## Department purpose\r\n\r\nProvide or coordinate the provision of learning\
  \ interventions that lead to improved performance and service delivery in the public\
  \ sector.\r\n\r\n## Mandate\r\n\r\nThe National School of Government derives its\
  \ mandate from the Public Service Amendment Act (2007). In terms of the act, the\
  \ institution is mandated to provide training or effect the provision of training.\
  \ This is to ensure that public servants are given capacity in the relevant competencies\
  \ that are central to creating a developmental state. The operational activities\
  \ of the school are located within the National School of Government training trading\
  \ account. The National School of Government was established in terms of a presidential\
  \ proclamation in 2013 to replace the Public Administration Leadership and Management\
  \ Academy. The proclamation was followed by the Public Administration Management\
  \ Act (2014). The National School of Government uses its trading account as a delivery\
  \ vehicle for its core outputs."
