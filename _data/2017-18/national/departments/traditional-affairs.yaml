intro: "## Department purpose\r\n\r\nCoordinate traditional affairs across government\
  \ through the development of appropriate policies, norms and standards, systems,\
  \ and regulatory frameworks; and promote culture, heritage and social cohesion.\r\
  \n\r\n## Mandate\r\n\r\nThe department\u2019s mandate extends beyond traditional\
  \ and KhoiSan leadership and communities, and includes overseeing a full range of\
  \ tasks inherent in dealing with all issues of traditional affairs.\r\nThe 2003\
  \ White Paper on Traditional Leadership and Governance sets out a national framework,\
  \ norms and standards that define the role and place of the institution of traditional\
  \ leadership within the South African system of democratic governance. It seeks\
  \ to support and transform the institution in accordance with  constitutional imperatives,\
  \ and to restore the integrity and legitimacy of the institution in line with the\
  \ African indigenous law and customs subject to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe mandate\
  \ of the Department of Traditional Affairs is informed by the following constitutional\
  \ and legislative frameworks:\r\n\r\n* the Traditional Leadership and Governance\
  \ Framework Act (2003)\r\n* the National House of Traditional Leaders Act (2009)\r\
  \n* the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious\
  \ and Linguistic Communities Act (2002)."
