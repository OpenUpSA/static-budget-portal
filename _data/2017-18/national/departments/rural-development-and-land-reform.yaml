  \ all South Africans.\r\n\r\n## Mandate\r\n\r\nThe Department of Rural Development\
  \ and Land Reform executes its legislative mandate based on several acts:\r\n\r\n\
  * The Restitution of Land Rights Act (1994), which provides for the restitution\
  \ of rights in land to persons or communities dispossessed of such rights after\
  \ 19 June 1913. The act established a Commission on Restitution of Land Rights and\
  \ a Land Claims Court. The minister is authorised to purchase, acquire and expropriate\
  \ land or rights in land for the purpose of restitution awards.\r\n* The Provision\
  \ of Land and Assistance Act (1993), which provides for the designation of certain\
  \ land, the regulation of the subdivision of such land and the settlement of persons\
  \ on it. It also provides for the acquisition, maintenance, planning, development,\
  \ improvement and disposal of property and the provision of financial assistance\
  \ for land reform purposes.\r\n* The Communal Property Associations Act (1996),\
  \ which enables communities to form juristic persons, to be known as communal property\
  \ associations, in order to acquire, hold and manage property on a basis agreed\
  \ to by members of a community in terms of a written constitution.\r\n* The Transformation\
  \ of Certain Rural Areas Act (1998), which provides for the transfer of certain\
  \ land to municipalities and certain other legal entities, as well as for the removal\
  \ of restrictions on the alienation of land.\r\n* The Physical Planning Act (1991),\
  \ which promotes the orderly physical development of South Africa, with provisions\
  \ for the division of the country into regions; and for the preparation of national\
  \ development plans, regional development plans, regional structure plans and urban\
  \ structure plans.\r\n* The Deeds Registries Act (1997), which provides for the\
  \ administration of the land registration system and the registration of land rights.\r\
  \n* The Land Survey Act (1997), which provides for the regulation of the survey\
  \ of land in South Africa.\r\n* The Sectional Titles Act (1986), which provides\
  \ for the division of buildings into sections and common property; the acquisition\
  \ of separate ownership in sections coupled with joint ownership in common property;\
  \ the control of certain incidents attached to separate ownership in sections, and\
  \ joint ownership in common property; the transfer of ownership of sections, and\
  \ the registration of sectional mortgage bonds and real rights in sections; the\
  \ conferring and registration of rights in and the disposal of common property;\
  \ the establishment of bodies corporate to control common property and for that\
  \ purpose to apply rules; and the establishment of a sectional titles regulation\
  \ board.\r\n* The Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act (2013), which provides\
  \ for national land use\r\nmanagement and spatial planning systems; the development\
  \ of government facilities such as hospitals, clinics and schools; and rural development\
  \ plans, guidelines, and norms and standards.\r\n* In addition to overseeing land\
  \ restitution, the department is also mandated with initiating, facilitating,\r\n\
  coordinating, catalysing and implementing an integrated rural development programme,\
  \ which is linked to outcome 7 (comprehensive rural development and land reform)\
  \ of government\u2019s 2014-2019 medium-term strategic framework."
