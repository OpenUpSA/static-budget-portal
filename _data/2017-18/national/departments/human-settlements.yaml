narrative:
  mandate:
    content: "The Department of Human Settlements derives its core mandate and\nresponsibilities\
      \ from section\_26 of the Constitution and section\_3 of the\nHousing Act\_\
      (1997), read in conjunction with approved policies and chapter\_8\nof the National\
      \ Development Plan\_(NDP). This allows the department, in\ncollaboration with\
      \ provinces and municipalities, to establish and facilitate a\nsustainable national\
      \ housing development process. The department does this by:\ndetermining national\
      \ policy and national norms and standards for housing and\nhuman settlements\
      \ development; and setting broad national housing delivery\ngoals, and monitoring\
      \ the financial and non-financial performance of provinces\nand municipalities\
      \ against these goals. In executing these roles and\nresponsibilities, the department\
      \ also builds capacity for provinces and\nmunicipalities, and promotes consultation\
      \ with all stakeholders in the housing\ndelivery chain, including civil society\
      \ and the private sector.\n\n"
