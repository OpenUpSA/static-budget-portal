intro: "## Vote purpose\n\n_Facilitate the creation of sustainable human settlements\
  \ and the improvement\nto household quality of life._\n\n\n\n## Mandate\n\nThe Department\
  \ of Human Settlements derives its core mandate and\nresponsibilities from section\_\
  26 of the Constitution and section\_3 of the\nHousing Act\_(1997), read in conjunction\
  \ with approved policies and chapter\_8\nof the National Development Plan\_(NDP).\
  \ This allows the department, in\ncollaboration with provinces and municipalities,\
  \ to establish and facilitate a\nsustainable national housing development process.\
  \ The department does this by:\ndetermining national policy and national norms and\
  \ standards for housing and\nhuman settlements development; and setting broad national\
  \ housing delivery\ngoals, and monitoring the financial and non-financial performance\
  \ of provinces\nand municipalities against these goals. In executing these roles\
  \ and\nresponsibilities, the department also builds capacity for provinces and\n\
  municipalities, and promotes consultation with all stakeholders in the housing\n\
  delivery chain, including civil society and the private sector.\n\n"
