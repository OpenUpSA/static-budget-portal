    content: 'The mandate of the Department of Tourism, as outlined in the Tourism
      Act

      (2014), is to promote growth and development of the tourism sector; promote

      quality tourism products and services; provide for the effective domestic and

      international marketing of South Africa as a tourist destination; enhance

      cooperation and coordination between all spheres of government in developing

      and managing tourism; and promote the practice of responsible tourism for the

      benefit of South Africa and for the enjoyment of all its residents and foreign

      visitors.


      In recognition of tourism as a national priority, with a potential to

      contribute significantly to economic development, the 1996 White Paper on the

      Development and Promotion of Tourism in South Africa provides for the

      promotion of domestic and international tourism. The national tourism sector

      strategy provides a blueprint for the sector to meet the growth targets

      contained in the National Development Plan (NDP).
