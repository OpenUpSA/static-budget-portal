intro: '## Vote purpose


  _Promote and support the growth and development of an equitable, competitive

  and sustainable tourism sector, enhancing its contribution to national

  priorities._




  ## Mandate


  The mandate of the Department of Tourism, as outlined in the Tourism Act

  (2014), is to promote growth and development of the tourism sector; promote

  quality tourism products and services; provide for the effective domestic and

  international marketing of South Africa as a tourist destination; enhance

  cooperation and coordination between all spheres of government in developing

  and managing tourism; and promote the practice of responsible tourism for the

  benefit of South Africa and for the enjoyment of all its residents and foreign

  visitors.


  In recognition of tourism as a national priority, with a potential to

  contribute significantly to economic development, the 1996 White Paper on the

  Development and Promotion of Tourism in South Africa provides for the

  promotion of domestic and international tourism. The national tourism sector

  strategy provides a blueprint for the sector to meet the growth targets

  contained in the National Development Plan (NDP).
