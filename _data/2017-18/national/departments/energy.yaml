  \ and oversee\ntheir implementation, to ensure energy security, the promotion of\n\
  environmentally friendly energy carriers, and access to affordable and\nreliable\
  \ energy for all South Africans._\n\n\n\n## Mandate\n\nThe Department of Energy\
  \ is mandated to ensure the secure and sustainable\nprovision of energy, in support\
  \ of socioeconomic development. It aims to\nachieve this by developing an integrated\
  \ energy plan for the entire energy\nsector and regulating energy industries, and\
  \ promoting investment in\naccordance with the integrated resource plan for electricity.\
  \ A number of acts\nregulate the energy sector and reflect the legislative measures\
  \ the department\nhas instituted to govern the energy sector.\n\n  * Key among these\
  \ are:\n\n  * the National Energy Act (2008)\n\n  * the Petroleum Products Act (1977)\n\
  \n  * the Electricity Regulation Act (2006).\n\n  * The National Energy Act (2008)\
  \ sets out the core aspects of the department\u2019s mandate and is the enabling\
  \ legislation that empowers the Minister of Energy to:\n\n  * ensure that diverse\
  \ energy resources are available in sustainable quantities and at affordable prices\
  \ in the South African economy to support economic growth and poverty alleviation,\
  \ while taking into account environmental considerations\n\n  * plan for the increased\
  \ generation and consumption of renewable energy, a contingency energy supply, the\
  \ holding of strategic energy feedstock and carriers, adequate investment in appropriate\
  \ upkeep, and access to energy infrastructure\n\n  * collect data and information\
  \ regarding energy demand, supply and generation\n\n  * promote electricity regulation,\
  \ energy research and the efficient generation and consumption of energy.\n\nThe\
  \ department is also mandated to regulate the petroleum industry at the\nmanufacturing,\
  \ wholesale and retail levels through the implementation of the\nPetroleum Products\
  \ Act (1977). The Petroleum and Liquid Fuels Charter is\nannexed to the Petroleum\
  \ Products Amendment Act (2003), and outlines the\ndepartment\u2019s strategy to\
  \ effect transformation in the industry.\n\nIn terms of its policy mandate, the\
  \ department is working with a range of\ndocuments and legislation that support\
  \ the long-term vision for South Africa\nto use as much renewable energy as possible;\
  \ create the necessary conditions\nto stimulate an efficient electricity market;\
  \ and position South Africa to\nbecome globally competitive in the use of innovative\
  \ technology for the\ndesign, manufacture and deployment of state-of-the-art nuclear\
  \ energy systems,\npower reactors and nuclear fuel cycle systems.\n\n"
