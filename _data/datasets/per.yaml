- name: "PER: Housing Programmatic Comparison"
  description: The promise of better housing has been a central plank of public policy since 1994. To this end, the government has provided public finance for a range of housing programmes, collectively dubbed ‘RDP housing’. These programmes aim to establish communities and neighbourhoods with access to healthcare, education and other social amenities. One of their basic components is the construction of permanent homes with security of tenure, which provide privacy, protection against the elements, and access to potable water, sanitation and energy.

- name: "PER: Rapid Verification of Informal Settlements"
  description: The Informal Settlements Service Delivery Rapid Verification Study is not a typical performance and expenditure review (PER). It was commissioned by the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation in the Presidency in December 2013 in order to help assess the extent to which government could rely on data prepared and presented by various departments about the delivery of services to communities and households living in informal settlements after it was reported that the target set for service delivery had been achieved. The target had been to provide 400 000 households with upgraded services (in situ or greenfield) and security of tenure between April 2010 and February 2014. The aim of the study was to assess the reliability of the data from various departments underpinning these claims.
