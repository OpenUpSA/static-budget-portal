intro_short: "This dataset includes expenditure data as published in the Estimates\
  \ of Provincial Revenue and Expenditure. Departmental expenditure data in previous\
  \ financial years have been aligned with the budget and programme structures of\
  \ departments as they are structured in the current Medium Term Expenditure Framework.\
  \ This means that the structure of historical expenditure data for a department,\
  \ may not necessarily reflect the same structure of that department when expenditure\
  \ was incurred during a particular financial year. This may be due to functions\
  \ shifts which may have occurred within a particular department or a general change\
  \ in a department\u2019s budget programme structures (BPS) as departments are afforded\
  \ an opportunity before the start of the Budget to change their BPS.This is to ensure\
  \ a more economical, efficient and effective delivery of public services and performance\
  \ by the department as a whole."
