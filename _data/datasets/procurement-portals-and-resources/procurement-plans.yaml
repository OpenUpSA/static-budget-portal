use_for: Using this information, citizen based monitoring efforts can be focused on
  ensuring departments maintain continuity of services when key contracts are coming
  to an end and a new round of contracting is occurring. By examining the reports
  in conjunction with Annual Performance Plans, it can be determined if a department
  / entity is intended to achieve planned objectives by obtaining the correct goods
  and services on time. Where no procurement plan was furnished, the department /
  entity's Annual Financial Statement can be examined for a sense of whether governance
  practices are a concern.
