  \ facts, breach their contracts or engage in poor performance etc. from doing business\
  \ with the state. \r\n2. The actions of National Treasury should be triggered by\
  \ the instruction/request from the Accounting Officer of a particular institution.\r\
  \n3. The fields contained in the list include: name of the supplier, their registration\
  \ number or ID number of director, reason for restriction and the duration of the\
  \ restriction.\r\n4. Suppliers are not barred from doing business with the state\
  \ indefinitely. This allows them the opportunity to rectify the errors that led\
  \ to the restriction."
