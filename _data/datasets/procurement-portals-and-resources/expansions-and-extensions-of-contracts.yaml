description: Requests from national departments and public entities to expand and
  extend existing contracts rather than request new bids from potential suppliers
  to perform the work.
importance: If a department or entity is frequently asking to expand contracts, it
  can be an indication that the procurement function of the department / entity is
  not planning its procurement adequately and is therefore seeking to prolong the
  duration and/or value of existing contracts. It can also serve as an indication
  of possible poor governance practices and service delivery issues.
intro: Requests from national departments and public entities to expand and extend
  existing contracts rather than request new bids from potential suppliers to perform
  the work.
intro_short: Requests from national departments and public entities to expand and
  extend existing contracts rather than request new bids from potential suppliers
  to perform the work.
key_points: "1. Requests for expansions may entail expanding the contract value and/or\
  \ extending the duration of the contract with no cost implications.\r\n2. An expired\
  \ contract cannot be extended or expanded.\r\n3. Accounting Officers are responsible\
  \ for approving expansions and extensions below the prescribed threshold, if the\
  \ thresholds are exceeded, these should be directed to the relevant Treasury.\r\n\
  4. A request to expand or extend a contract may be justified in order to ensure\
  \ continuity of service or to finalise outstanding work not completed within the\
  \ contract specifications or timelines particularly if there were delays beyond\
  \ the control of the supplier.\r\n5. It is not good practice to request expansions,\
  \ but preferable to keep the value of expansions to 15% of the initial contract\
  \ value for goods or services and 20% for construction.\r\n6. Expansions and extension\
  \ should be the exception rather than the norm and should not be requested frequently."

usage: "1. Visit [National Treasury's OCPO website](http://ocpo.treasury.gov.za/Suppliers_Area/Pages/Deviations-and-Exspansions.aspx)\r\
  \n2. Go to Suppliers Area\r\n3. Select Deviations and Expansions\r\n4. Download\
  \ the report for the relevant quarter"
use_for: The quarterly expansions and extension reports report lists the department/entity
  requesting the extension/expansion, the project description, the supplier, the reason
  provided for requesting the expansion/extension, the original contract value, the
  value of the contract extension/expansion, value of previous extensions/expansions,
  date that the department/entity made the request, whether Treasury supported the
  request and the contract start and end date. This information can be used to gain
  a snapshot of the procurement practices of departments/entities. The information
  can be analysed in conjunction with National Treasury guidelines for managing deviations,
  contract variations and expansions.
