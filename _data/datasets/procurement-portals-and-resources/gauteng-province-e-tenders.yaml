importance: "Gauteng's Open Tender innovation includes public scrutiny over the opening\
  \ of the tender boxes and imprinting of all documents, appointing external, independent\
  \ probity auditors to scrutinize every phase of the tender evaluation process to\
  \ ensure total compliance with laws and regulations, and most important of all the\
  \ public adjudication of the decision on the recommended service provider where\
  \ bidders, the media and interested members of the public can watch the proceedings.\
  \ Transparent tender procurement processes are more likely to be free from corruption\
  \ and achieve their intended development objectives than processes where the information\
  \ is not readily available. It also promotes small businesses in line with government\u2019\
  s commitment to economic transformation and inclusion."

use_for: The Gauteng Open Tender system enables the public to scrutinize the entire
  tender process. Using the information on the system, citizen based monitoring efforts
  can be focused on ensuring Gauteng's provincial departments maintain continuity
  of services when key contracts are coming to an end and a new round of contracting
  is occurring. By examining the information in conjunction with Annual Performance
  Plans, it can be determined if a provincial department is poising itself to achieve
  planned performance by obtaining the correct goods and services on time.
