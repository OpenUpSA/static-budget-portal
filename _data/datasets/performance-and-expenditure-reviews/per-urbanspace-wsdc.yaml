description: Although significant progress has been made in providing water to households
  and communities who had no access to these services before 1994, sizeable backlogs
  remain. According to the 2011 census, 2.2 million households still lack access to
  the RDP-standard water supply, and over 5 million households (or 33%) experience
  problems with their supply. Growth in sectors such as agriculture, mining and energy
  also depends heavily on reliable access to water.
