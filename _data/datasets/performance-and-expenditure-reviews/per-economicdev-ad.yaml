description: There is wide agreement that South Africa produces too few artisans to
  meet the needs of the economy and that improving the efficiency and effectiveness
  of the artisan development system is important for accelerating growth and reducing
  unemployment. Indeed, the National Development Plan (NDP) sets a target of producing
  30 000 artisans a year by 2030, which would be more than double the number of artisans
  who graduated in 2013. (This was already considerably higher than the low point
  of 2005, when only 4 500 artisans graduated.)
