  description: The main purpose of this performance and expenditure review (PER) was
    to understand how much is being spent on provincial roads, what drives this expenditure,
    and what is being delivered. The aim was to identify where spending might be inefficient,
    which could inform policy decisions and improve value for money. The PER aimed
    to analyse the unit cost per kilometre of provincial roads, taking into account
    the different costs structures across provinces due to topographical, climatic,
    soil and other differences.

  description: "Provincial roads are a vital cog in the South African economy, and\
    \ key to ensuring access to social services. They are generally a high-use infrastructure,\
    \ the condition of which has a significant impact on users\u2019 experience and\
    \ their potential contribution to economic activity. The need to maintain roads\
    \ does not wait for provincial road management systems to be in place or for budget\
    \ processes to run their course, with the costs of maintenance rising exponentially\
    \ with the deterioration of their condition. Furthermore, what happens in one\
    \ section of the network can dramatically affect other parts. If a stretch of\
    \ road goes into disrepair, fewer people use that section, which has an impact\
    \ on alternate routes and feeder roads. At any one time, there are many sections\
    \ of road in a network that require work, but resource constraints mean that only\
    \ a small proportion can be selected for work to be done. This document is a report\
    \ on a performance expenditure review (PER) on provincial roads. The key output\
    \ of this PER is a costing model that enables users to develop cost estimates\
    \ of a variety of kinds of roads projects in a variety of different conditions.\
    \ The costing model can be applied and adapted to all conditions that exist in\
    \ South Africa if the relevant data is provided and input. The model can generate\
    \ estimates for all conditions, though some judgement will be required if it is\
    \ to be used optimally. Users can utilise the model to obtain alternate costings\
    \ of projects by tweaking variables, and therefore have a powerful tool to quickly\
    \ compare different approaches to the same sections of roads. This also supports\
    \ institutional knowledge accumulation and learning as officials can quickly compare\
    \ the impact of these differences on project costs."
