  description: There is wide agreement that South Africa produces too few artisans
    to meet the needs of the economy and that improving the efficiency and effectiveness
    of the artisan development system is important for accelerating growth and reducing
    unemployment. Indeed, the National Development Plan (NDP) sets a target of producing
    30 000 artisans a year by 2030, which would be more than double the number of
    artisans who graduated in 2013. (This was already considerably higher than the
    low point of 2005, when only 4 500 artisans graduated.)

  description: "The biofuels regulatory framework aims to encourage the production\
    \ of biofuel on a commercial scale by establishing transparent criteria for selecting\
    \ biofuel manufacturing projects. To achieve a 2% penetration of biofuels into\
    \ the local transport fuel pool, an incentive scheme was announced in 2013 that\
    \ will provide a guaranteed return on assets of 15% to an efficient biofuels producer.\
    \ It is hoped that the commercial production of biofuels will stimulate significant\
    \ economic development and employment in the agricultural sector. The fiscal production\
    \ incentive for biofuels will be funded by a biofuels levy on all petrol and diesel\
    \ sold for domestic consumption. The level of the incentive required to generate\
    \ the 15% return on assets in an indicative efficient biofuels plant will be determined\
    \ on a monthly basis via a biofuels incentive model. Should a biofuels manufacturer\u2019\
    s return on assets exceed 20%, a \u2018claw-back\u2019 would come into effect,\
    \ in terms of which it would pay the \u2018excessive\u2019 profits back to the\
    \ subsidy scheme"

    \ the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) intends to shift the formal immigration\
    \ policy from trying to protect domestic workers to seeking actively to alleviate\
    \ the country\u2019s skills shortages. This is in line with the National Development\
    \ Plan, which set a target of 50 000 scarce-skill visas to be issued by 2030.\
    \ In terms of DHA policy, foreign workers with scarce skills may apply for a category\
    \ of work visa called critical skills visas (CSVs)."

  description: There is a lack of a comprehensive policy framework for fleet management.
    The National Transport Circular 4 of 2000 is outdated; while it is currently being
    updated, it only covers the authorisation and usage of individual vehicles. Provinces
    have to compile their own policies, procedures and management practices for determining
    fleet size, age usage and composition.

    To achieve this, a detailed understanding of the institutions and operational
    mandates that govern revenue management systems was developed. Revenue and expenditure
    on payment systems was estimated and then projected forward from 2017/2018 to
    2021/2022 in an expenditure and revenue costing model. An efficiencies and trade-offs
    model was then applied to these projections in order to identify the most efficient
    components of payment systems across the nine provinces. '

    \ and just 20% less than the total income of households in the middle 20%. In\

  description: "Provincial roads are a vital cog in the South African economy, and\
    \ key to ensuring access to social services. They are generally a high-use infrastructure,\
    \ the condition of which has a significant impact on users\u2019 experience and\
    \ their potential contribution to economic activity. The need to maintain roads\
    \ does not wait for provincial road management systems to be in place or for budget\
    \ processes to run their course, with the costs of maintenance rising exponentially\
    \ with the deterioration of their condition. Furthermore, what happens in one\
    \ section of the network can dramatically affect other parts. If a stretch of\
    \ road goes into disrepair, fewer people use that section, which has an impact\
    \ on alternate routes and feeder roads. At any one time, there are many sections\
    \ of road in a network that require work, but resource constraints mean that only\
    \ a small proportion can be selected for work to be done. This document is a report\
    \ on a performance expenditure review (PER) on provincial roads. The key output\
    \ of this PER is a costing model that enables users to develop cost estimates\
    \ of a variety of kinds of roads projects in a variety of different conditions.\
    \ The costing model can be applied and adapted to all conditions that exist in\
    \ South Africa if the relevant data is provided and input. The model can generate\
    \ estimates for all conditions, though some judgement will be required if it is\
    \ to be used optimally. Users can utilise the model to obtain alternate costings\
    \ of projects by tweaking variables, and therefore have a powerful tool to quickly\
    \ compare different approaches to the same sections of roads. This also supports\
    \ institutional knowledge accumulation and learning as officials can quickly compare\
    \ the impact of these differences on project costs."
