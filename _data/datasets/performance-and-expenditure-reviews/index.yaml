  description: There is wide agreement that South Africa produces too few artisans
    to meet the needs of the economy and that improving the efficiency and effectiveness
    of the artisan development system is important for accelerating growth and reducing
    unemployment. Indeed, the National Development Plan (NDP) sets a target of producing
    30 000 artisans a year by 2030, which would be more than double the number of
    artisans who graduated in 2013. (This was already considerably higher than the
    low point of 2005, when only 4 500 artisans graduated.)

  description: "The biofuels regulatory framework aims to encourage the production\
    \ of biofuel on a commercial scale by establishing transparent criteria for selecting\
    \ biofuel manufacturing projects. To achieve a 2% penetration of biofuels into\
    \ the local transport fuel pool, an incentive scheme was announced in 2013 that\
    \ will provide a guaranteed return on assets of 15% to an efficient biofuels producer.\
    \ It is hoped that the commercial production of biofuels will stimulate significant\
    \ economic development and employment in the agricultural sector. The fiscal production\
    \ incentive for biofuels will be funded by a biofuels levy on all petrol and diesel\
    \ sold for domestic consumption. The level of the incentive required to generate\
    \ the 15% return on assets in an indicative efficient biofuels plant will be determined\
    \ on a monthly basis via a biofuels incentive model. Should a biofuels manufacturer\u2019\
    s return on assets exceed 20%, a \u2018claw-back\u2019 would come into effect,\
    \ in terms of which it would pay the \u2018excessive\u2019 profits back to the\
    \ subsidy scheme"

  description: Government departments lease much of their office accommodation from
    private landlords, with national departments incurring around R3 billion a year
    in rental expenses. The South African Police Service, which is the largest national
    department and has the largest geographical footprint, incurs about a quarter
    of this total.

    issue of poor revenue collection rates at public health facilities in South Africa.
    To achieve this, a detailed understanding of the institutions and operational
    mandates that govern revenue management systems was developed. Revenue and expenditure
    on payment systems was estimated and then projected forward from 2017/2018 to
    2021/2022 in an expenditure and revenue costing model. An efficiencies and trade-offs
    model was then applied to these projections in order to identify the most efficient
    components of payment systems across the nine provinces. '

  description: To enhance the quality of teaching and the outcomes of the basic education
    system, the national Department of Basic Education (DBE) developed a plan for
    the in-service training of teachers (INSET). The goal is to deepen their subject
    expertise as well as their pedagogical knowledge. The Integrated Strategic Planning
    Framework for Teacher Education and Development in South Africa emerged from extensive
    research and collaboration among a range of stakeholders, including provincial
    education departments, academics and teacher unions. It specifies what educators
    should know, and having established the nature of the gaps, identifies suitable
    institutions to provide the required training. The policy proposals are extensive
    and will require substantial public resources to implement.

  description: "In the mid-1990s, government introduced the Integrated Nutrition Programme.\
    \ It aimed to improve the health of the poor by delivering a range of nutrition-specific\
    \ interventions (e.g. vitamin supplementation, deworming, and nutrition education)\
    \ and complementary interventions (e.g. the provision of water, sanitation and\
    \ income support to indigent households). However, malnutrition remains a significant\
    \ challenge. The most recent data shows that one in four children aged 1\u2013\
    3 years are stunted, which is higher than in countries with comparable levels\
    \ of income. Malnutrition contributes to the relatively high levels of sickness\
    \ and death among children: of the children who died before age 5 in 2008, more\
    \ than 60% were underweight and 30% were severely malnourished."

  description: "Provincial roads are a vital cog in the South African economy, and\
    \ key to ensuring access to social services. They are generally a high-use infrastructure,\
    \ the condition of which has a significant impact on users\u2019 experience and\
    \ their potential contribution to economic activity. The need to maintain roads\
    \ does not wait for provincial road management systems to be in place or for budget\
    \ processes to run their course, with the costs of maintenance rising exponentially\
    \ with the deterioration of their condition. Furthermore, what happens in one\
    \ section of the network can dramatically affect other parts. If a stretch of\
    \ road goes into disrepair, fewer people use that section, which has an impact\
    \ on alternate routes and feeder roads. At any one time, there are many sections\
    \ of road in a network that require work, but resource constraints mean that only\
    \ a small proportion can be selected for work to be done. This document is a report\
    \ on a performance expenditure review (PER) on provincial roads. The key output\
    \ of this PER is a costing model that enables users to develop cost estimates\
    \ of a variety of kinds of roads projects in a variety of different conditions.\
    \ The costing model can be applied and adapted to all conditions that exist in\
    \ South Africa if the relevant data is provided and input. The model can generate\
    \ estimates for all conditions, though some judgement will be required if it is\
    \ to be used optimally. Users can utilise the model to obtain alternate costings\
    \ of projects by tweaking variables, and therefore have a powerful tool to quickly\
    \ compare different approaches to the same sections of roads. This also supports\

  description: 'The purpose of this study was to obtain relevant data and analyse
    the costs and revenues associated with provincial government renting state-owned
    residential properties to private tenants in the period 2013/14 to 2015/16.


    The key objectives of the project were to:


    - Identify and quantify all costs and revenues associated with the management
    of state-owned residential rental properties by provincial governments.

    - Assess the quality and comprehensiveness of available data on leases and rentals.

    - Estimate the discrepancy between rentals charged and market-related rates that
    could be obtained for similar properties.

    - Identify weaknesses in rent-collection systems and processes and make recommendations
    to address them.

    - Make recommendations to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of property
    rental processes.'
