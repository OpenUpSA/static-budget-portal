description: "South Africa\u2019s land restitution programmes date back to the Restitution\
  \ Act in 1994 and the opening of the land claims process in 1995. The aim was to\
  \ return a significant proportion of land forcibly taken from individuals and communities\
  \ after the passage of the 1913 Land Act, and the Commission of Restitution of Land\
  \ Rights was established to undertake this process. Eligible claimants were given\
  \ three years from 1 May 1995 to lodge claims, which was later extended to 31 December\
  \ 1998. By that point, around 60 000 claims had been lodged, some of which were\
  \ for more than one property."
