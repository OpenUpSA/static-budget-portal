description: 'The purpose of this study was to obtain relevant data and analyse the
  costs and revenues associated with provincial government renting state-owned residential
  properties to private tenants in the period 2013/14 to 2015/16.


  The key objectives of the project were to:


  - Identify and quantify all costs and revenues associated with the management of
  state-owned residential rental properties by provincial governments.

  - Assess the quality and comprehensiveness of available data on leases and rentals.

  - Estimate the discrepancy between rentals charged and market-related rates that
  could be obtained for similar properties.

  - Identify weaknesses in rent-collection systems and processes and make recommendations
  to address them.

  - Make recommendations to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of property rental
  processes.'
