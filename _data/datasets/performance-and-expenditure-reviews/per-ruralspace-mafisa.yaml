description: "The Micro Agricultural Financial Institutions of South Africa (MAFISA)\
  \ programme was launched as a pilot project in three provinces in 2004/05. Its goal\
  \ was to provide small, short- and medium-term loans to small-scale farmers to expand\
  \ production, particularly in communal land areas and on smallholdings with a variety\
  \ of tenure systems. MAFISA\u2019s approach was to channel funds appropriated to\
  \ the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) through the Land\
  \ Bank to established financial intermediaries who would make loans of up to R500\
  \ 000 to farmers. The programme\u2019s rules meant that the bulk of borrowed funds\
  \ were to be used to pay suppliers of agricultural equipment and other inputs. MAFISA\
  \ loan agreements stipulated that financial intermediaries generally would not pay\
  \ the borrowed funds to the beneficiary, but would pay the suppliers of approved\
  \ inputs and services directly.\u200B"
