description: 'This Performance and Expenditure Review (PER) aimed to address the issue
  of poor revenue collection rates at public health facilities in South Africa. To
  achieve this, a detailed understanding of the institutions and operational mandates
  that govern revenue management systems was developed. Revenue and expenditure on
  payment systems was estimated and then projected forward from 2017/2018 to 2021/2022
  in an expenditure and revenue costing model. An efficiencies and trade-offs model
  was then applied to these projections in order to identify the most efficient components
  of payment systems across the nine provinces. '
