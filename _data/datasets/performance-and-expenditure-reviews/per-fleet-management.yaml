description: There is a lack of a comprehensive policy framework for fleet management.
  The National Transport Circular 4 of 2000 is outdated; while it is currently being
  updated, it only covers the authorisation and usage of individual vehicles. Provinces
  have to compile their own policies, procedures and management practices for determining
  fleet size, age usage and composition.
