  the institutional performance of municipalities across a number of Key Performance
  Areas (KPAs).
intro_short: The LGMIM is a web-enabled assessment tool that is used to measure or
  benchmark the institutional performance of municipalities across a number of Key
  Performance Areas (KPAs).
key_points: "- The LGMIM framework is built around 6 KPAs, namely, Integrated Development\
  \ Planning and Implementation, Service Delivery, Human Resource Management, Financial\
  \ Management, Community Engagement/Participation and Governance.\r\n- LGMIM focusses\
  \ on the management practices of the municipality as an organisation.\r\n- It does\
  \ not focus on the performance of individuals \u2013 it is thus not an individual\
  \ performance management and development system.\r\n- LGMIM assesses the management\
  \ practices, based on existing legal, regulatory and prescribed best practise requirements\
  \ applicable to the Local Government Sphere.\r\n- LGMIM identifies four progressive\
  \ levels of management performance.\r\n- Each management performance standard is\
  \ assessed and scored against these four levels of performance.\r\n- This gives\
  \ each municipality an indication of how it performs in each of the management performance\
  \ standards and each KPA."
