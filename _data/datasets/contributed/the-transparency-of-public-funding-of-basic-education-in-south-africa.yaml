intro: Like their counterparts around the world, CSOs in South Africa need access
  to disaggregated budget data to be able to monitor budgeting for and expenditure
  on the delivery of services, such as basic education. But they struggle to find
  out whether the data they need is being produced or published, in which format,
  and by whom. Through conversations with these CSOs, IBP South Africa collected a
  range of education-related budget information requests and commissioned Cornerstone
  Economic Research to assess the availability of disaggregated budget data that responds
  to the requests. Download the report of what they found along with an accompanying
  report with background information on how education is funded in South Africa.

    the availability of disaggregated budget data that responds CSO requests for information
    needed to monitor funding for and the delivery of basic education. This report
    provides responses to the specific information requests, indicating where information
    can be found (where publicly available) or who in government is likely to be able
    to provide the information. It also raises interesting questions around who CSOs
    should engage with when advocating for more detailed and relevant budget data.
