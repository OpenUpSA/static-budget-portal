intro: "Tools and methods used for formulating and analysing government budgeting\
  \ for the progressive realisation of socio-economic rights\r\n\r\nA Guide for State\
  \ and non-State Human Rights Advocates and Researchers\r\n\r\nBudget analysis is\
  \ a key component of SER monitoring. It allows human rights advocates to\r\nanalyse\
  \ budgetary decisions made by governments, beginning with enforceable obligations\r\
  \nunder international and national law. Thus, an SER budget analyst must understand\r\
  \n\r\n1. the key components of a particular SER and how these components find expression\
  \ in budgets;\r\n2. the methods and logistics of obtaining and understanding budgets;\
  \ and\r\n3. how to connect a budget to the SER under review.\r\n\r\nArmed with these\
  \ skills and numbers, budget analysts can assess governments\u2019 budgetary policies\
  \ from a human rights basis, bringing to light successes and gaps, and providing\
  \ viable alternatives to current spending where necessary.\r\n\r\nThis Guide will\
  \ provide an overview of each of these aspects of SER monitoring, and how they\r\
  \ntranslate in the South African context, with reference to practical examples used\
  \ by civil society\r\nto monitor the advancement of SER through budget analysis.\
  \ It is envisioned that the Guide will\r\nprovide a useful resource for human rights\
  \ advocates to understand the process of monitoring\r\nthe progressive realisation\
  \ of SER using tools of budget analysis. It is also hoped that the Guide\r\nwill\
  \ inform renewed and coordinated activism amongst civil society groups and organisations\r\
  \ninterested in SER monitoring, through the production of evidence-based research\
  \ required\r\nto assist the government to reprioritise the budget in a manner that\
  \ advances, rather than\r\nhinders, the full realisation and enjoyment of SER. "

methodology: "The development of this Guide was informed by a variety of actors and\
  \ perspectives, including\r\npolicy-makers involved in SER budget decision-making\
  \ processes, and researchers and\r\norganisations that monitor the advancement of\
  \ SER in South Africa. A Roundtable discussion,\r\nhosted by SPII and the SAHRC,\
  \ brought together these various actors to discuss:\r\n\r\n_how the government budget\
  \ is formulated and implemented in a manner that either advances,\r\nor inhibits,\
  \ the progressive realisation of socio-economic rights, within \u2013 and to the\
  \ maximum of \u2013\r\navailable resources._\r\n\r\nPresentations were made by representatives\
  \ of the National Treasury, Open Democracy Advice\r\nCentre, Socio-Economic Rights\
  \ Institute, Black Sash, Social Justice Coalition, Equal Education\r\nand the Public\
  \ Service Accountability Monitor.\r\nThe Roundtable unpacked the conceptual challenges\
  \ and opportunities of engaging in SER\r\nbudget work; how the South African Constitution\
  \ informs budget prioritisation, formulation\r\nand implementation; the availability\
  \ of data that is transparent and accessible; and the practical\r\nimplications\
  \ of monitoring the advancement of SER through budget analysis."
