  \ of the Public Finance Management Act also outlines specific roles and responsibilities\
  \ for provincial Members of the Executive Councils (MECs). This includes the requirement\

  \ tabling of the national adjustments budget where a national adjustments budget\
  \ allocates funds to a province. Accounting Officers are also obliged to motivate\
  \ accordingly for adjusted budgets.  \r\nThis Guide is intended, in part, to support\
  \ civic actors participation in the MTBPS and Adjustments Budget by distilling key\
  \ budget information.\r\n"
