    \n\r\nThis guide is for community activists and organized civil society interested\
    \ in conducting social audits in South Africa. It aims to help these groups think\
    \ about, conduct, and reflect on social audits. The guide may also be of use to\
    \ other stakeholders (such as government) that want to better understand a process\
    \ they may be requested to participate in.\r\n\r\nThe guide can be used by civil\
    \ society organizations wishing to conduct a social audit, or adapted to train\
    \ community members or civil society organizations on the social audit methodology.\

    \ Policy Statement (MTBPS) and Adjusted Estimates of National Expenditure (AENE).\
    \ Section 12 of the Money Bills Amendment Procedures and Related Matters Act obliges\
    \ the Minister of Finance  to table a Division of Revenue Amendment Bill alongside\
    \ the revised fiscal framework with budget adjustments to the Division of Revenue\

    \ of the Public Finance Management Act also outlines specific roles and responsibilities\
    \ for provincial Members of the Executive Councils (MECs). This includes the requirement\
    \ for provincial treasuries to table an adjustments budget within 30 days of the\
    \ tabling of the national adjustments budget where a national adjustments budget\
    \ allocates funds to a province. Accounting Officers are also obliged to motivate\

  description: "Tools and methods used for formulating and analysing government budgeting\
    \ for the progressive realisation of socio-economic rights\r\n\r\nA Guide for\
    \ State and non-State Human Rights Advocates and Researchers\r\n\r\nBudget analysis\
    \ is a key component of SER monitoring. It allows human rights advocates to\r\n\
    analyse budgetary decisions made by governments, beginning with enforceable obligations\r\
    \nunder international and national law. Thus, an SER budget analyst must understand\r\
    \n\r\n1. the key components of a particular SER and how these components find\
    \ expression in budgets;\r\n2. the methods and logistics of obtaining and understanding\
    \ budgets; and\r\n3. how to connect a budget to the SER under review.\r\n\r\n\
    Armed with these skills and numbers, budget analysts can assess governments\u2019\
    \ budgetary policies from a human rights basis, bringing to light successes and\
    \ gaps, and providing viable alternatives to current spending where necessary.\r\
    \n\r\nThis Guide will provide an overview of each of these aspects of SER monitoring,\
    \ and how they\r\ntranslate in the South African context, with reference to practical\
    \ examples used by civil society\r\nto monitor the advancement of SER through\
    \ budget analysis. It is envisioned that the Guide will\r\nprovide a useful resource\
    \ for human rights advocates to understand the process of monitoring\r\nthe progressive\
    \ realisation of SER using tools of budget analysis. It is also hoped that the\
    \ Guide\r\nwill inform renewed and coordinated activism amongst civil society\
    \ groups and organisations\r\ninterested in SER monitoring, through the production\
    \ of evidence-based research required\r\nto assist the government to reprioritise\
    \ the budget in a manner that advances, rather than\r\nhinders, the full realisation\
    \ and enjoyment of SER. "

  description: "This brief analysis the budget allocations for the Eastern Cape Department\
    \ of Education\r\n(ECDoE) in relation to the progressive realisation of the rights\
    \ to quality basic education within\r\nProgramme 2: Public Ordinary Schools Education\
    \ for the 2018/19 financial year. This brief is situated\r\nwithin the planning\
    \ and resource allocation processes of the social accountability system (SAM),\
    \ and\r\nusing a rights-based approach to evaluating resource allocation for Programme\
    \ 2. This approach places\r\nan obligation on the state to fulfill the rights\
    \ of citizens to quality basic education, as enshrined in Section 29 of the Constitution.\
    \ The state has an obligation to progressively realise the rights of citizens\
    \ to quality basic education, and to access and use available resources optimally\
    \ and equitably in doing so. In addition, the purpose of this brief is to analyse\
    \ the change in budget allocations from the Adjusted\r\nAppropriations of the\
    \ 2017/18 financial year, nominal and real budget allocations for the 2018/19\r\
    \nfinancial year, as well as percent (%) changes in budget allocations for this\
    \ financial year. In order\r\ndetermine the allocations in real terms, this brief\
    \ makes use of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This is\r\nmeant to show the effect\
    \ of inflation on the purchasing power within the specific Programmes. While\r\
    \ngovernment focuses on the nominal allocations, this brief accounts for the effects\
    \ of inflation. This takes\r\ninto account that building new schools, for example,\
    \ will be more expensive this financial year than the\r\nlast financial year.\
    \ As such, government must ensure that budget allocations take inflation into\
    \ account\r\neach year."

  description: "Mapping Fiscal Transparency Gaps and Needs in Developing Countries\r\
    \n \r\nGovernments sometimes complain that the budget information they make publicly\
    \ available is seldom accessed and utilized. On the other hand, civil society\
    \ organizations (CSOs) often claim that the information governments make available\
    \ is very difficult to understand and not detailed enough to allow for meaningful\
    \ analysis and advocacy. Is there a mismatch between the budget information supplied\
    \ by governments and demand among civil society?\r\n\r\nThis paper examines the\
    \ \u201Cdemand side\u201D of fiscal transparency using findings from a global\
    \ survey of 176 individuals working in civil society that use budget information\
    \ for analysis and advocacy activities. Based on the responses, the authors identify\
    \ a \u201Cfiscal transparency effectiveness gap\u201D between the fiscal information\
    \ that governments often provide and the information that CSOs need.\r\n\r\nThese\
    \ findings are used to develop a set of recommendations to help governments ensure\
    \ their transparency practices deliver increased citizen engagement, improved\
    \ oversight, and enhanced accountability."

  description: "How transparent and participatory are the budgets of Metropolitan\
    \ Municipalities in South Africa?\r\n\r\nEvidence from around the world shows\
    \ that when there is public participation in public finance decision making and\
    \ oversight, it can lead to better policy choices, deeper public trust in government,\
    \ and stronger accountability over the actual use of public money to provide services\
    \ on the ground. Such participation, however, is only meaningful when the public\
    \ has access to information about the government\u2019s plans, activities and\
    \ the fiscal constraints it faces.\r\n\r\nWhile the national government has undergone\
    \ regular budget transparency and participation assessments through the Open Budget\
    \ Survey since 2006, to date there has not been a similar assessment of public\
    \ finance management systems and practices for local and provincial governments.\
    \ This is about to change, as the International Budget Partnership South Africa\
    \ is preparing to launch a Metro OBI. The Metro OBI will complete the public finance\
    \ transparency and participation picture in South Africa by assessing transparency\
    \ and participation in the metropolitan municipalities (metros). Four of the eight\
    \ metro municipalities will be assessed in 2018.\r\n\r\nThis paper introduces\
    \ the Metro Open Budget Index and explains how the Metro OBI questionnaire was\

  description: Dilapidated public school infrastructure can be found across the country,
    but the problem is particularly acute in the Eastern Cape where the majority of
    the so called 'mud schools' are located. On 04 February 2011, following court
    action on the issue of mud schools, the Legal Resources Centre, acting on behalf
    of 7 schools and the Centre for Child Law, concluded a landmark settlement with
    the National Department of Basic Education in which the Department committed to
    spend R8.2 billion from 1 April 2011 to 1 March 2014 to eradicate mud schools
    and improve infrastructure of schools throughout South Africa. The Centre for
    Child Law commissioned Cornerstone Economic Research, to track school infrastructure
    spending and delivery. The aim of the research was to assess what progress has
    been made in addressing the issues that brought about the litigation. This study,
    amongst other things, makes the concerning finding that the Department has woefully
    underspent the allocated school infrastructure funding for two years running.
    The target for the number of schools to be built in 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 was
    49. However, only 10 schools had been completed at the end of the first year.

  description: Like their counterparts around the world, CSOs in South Africa need
    access to disaggregated budget data to be able to monitor budgeting for and expenditure
    on the delivery of services, such as basic education. But they struggle to find
    out whether the data they need is being produced or published, in which format,
    and by whom. Through conversations with these CSOs, IBP South Africa collected
    a range of education-related budget information requests and commissioned Cornerstone
    Economic Research to assess the availability of disaggregated budget data that
    responds to the requests. Download the report of what they found along with an
    accompanying report with background information on how education is funded in
    South Africa.

  - description: IBP South Africa commissioned Cornerstone Economic Research to assess
      the availability of disaggregated budget data that responds CSO requests for
      information needed to monitor funding for and the delivery of basic education.
      This report provides responses to the specific information requests, indicating
      where information can be found (where publicly available) or who in government
      is likely to be able to provide the information. It also raises interesting
      questions around who CSOs should engage with when advocating for more detailed
      and relevant budget data.
