intro: 'In performing the analysis, the budget brief made use of the budget allocations
  contained in the ENE and EPRE. This also made use of the annual and quarterly reports
  to account for expenditure. '
intro_short: 'The budget brief analyses the 2019/20 budget allocations to Programme
  6 (Infrastructure Development) of the Eastern Cape Department of Education (ECDoE).
  While this budget brief analyses the 2019/20 budget allocations, it also refers
  to past budget allocations between 2014 and 2018. The analysis of budget allocations
  will provide recommendations for the 6th administration. '
key_points: "Finding 1\r\n\r\nThe budget allocated to the Department of Basic Education\
  \ (DBE) increased by 4%, in nominal terms, over the years of the 5th national administration,\
  \ from R19.68 billion in 2014/15 to R24.50 billion in 2019/20. However, between\
  \ 2017/18 and 2018/19, the DBE experienced budget cuts. For example, the national\
  \ budget to the DBE decreased by 3% in nominal terms, from R23.40 billion in 2017/18\
  \ to R22.72  billion in 2018/19. \r\n\r\nFinding 2\r\n\r\nWhile the budget allocations\
  \ to the DBE increased by 4% between 2014/15 and 2019/20, the department faced underspending\
  \ and poor performance over the 5th national administration. For example, on the\
  \ target of building 100 schools in the 2014/15 financial year, the department only\
  \ built 24 schools. Also, the department only managed to build 9 schools against\
  \ the target of 50 schools in 2018/19. Underperformance was also reported in the\
  \ provision of sanitation to schools, where 64 schools were provided against a target\
  \ of 285 in 2018/19. \r\n\r\nFinding 3\r\n\r\nDuring the Eastern Cape 5th administration,\
  \ the budget allocations to the Eastern Cape Department of Education (ECDoE) increased\
  \ from R26.85 billion in 2014/15 to R36.32 billion in 2019/20. While the budget\
  \ allocation to the ECDoE increased by 4% from R34.89 billion in 2018/19 to R36.32\
  \ billion in 2019/20; in real terms, this only increased by 2% to R35.56 billion.\
  \ \r\n\r\nFinding 4\r\n\r\nWhile the allocations to Programme 6 (Infrastructure\
  \ Development) of the ECDoE increased during the 5th provincial administration,\
  \ from R1.10 billion in 2014 to R1.58 billion in 2019/20, it is worth noting that\
  \ the ECDoE experienced budget cuts between 2017/18 and 2018/19, specifically for\
  \ infrastructure development. The budget allocation decreased from R1.65 billion\
  \ in 2017/18 to the adjusted budget of R1.59 billion in 2018/19. This decrease continued\
  \ until the current financial year, where the allocation to the programme decreased\
  \ by 1% in nominal terms, from the adjusted budget of R1.59 billion in 2018/19 to\
  \ R1.58 billion in 2019/20. In real terms, this decreased by 3% to R1.55 billion.\
  \ It appears that the 5th provincial administration experienced budget cuts.  \r\
  \n\r\nFinding 5\r\n\r\nBetween 2017 and 2018, six (6) of the nine (9) provinces\
  \ had their budget allocations for the Education Infrastructure Grant (EIG) reduced\
  \ \u2013 with the Northern Cape having had the highest reduction by 21%, in nominal\
  \ terms, from R612 million in 2017/18 to R483 million in 2018/19. In nominal terms,\
  \ the allocations for the EIG to the Eastern Cape decreased by 5% from R1.58 billion\
  \ in 2017/18 to R1.47 billion in 2018/19, and increasing by 7% to R1.58 billion\
  \ in 2019/20. \r\n\r\nFinding 6\r\n\r\nBetween 2018/19 and 2019/20 the ECDoE still\
  \ experienced budget cuts, in nominal terms, in the following two (2) of the seven\
  \ (7) conditional grants: Maths, Science and Technology Grant (by 16%) and Learners\
  \ with Profound Intellectual Disabilities Grant (by 2%. In real terms, these two\
  \ conditional grants had their budget allocations decreased by 18% and 4% respectively.\
  \ With these reductions, it is unlikely that the ECDoE will provide  support and\
  \ resources to schools, teachers and learners with profound intellectual disabilities. "
