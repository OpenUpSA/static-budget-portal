intro: "How transparent and participatory are the budgets of Metropolitan Municipalities\
  \ in South Africa?\r\n\r\nEvidence from around the world shows that when there is\
  \ public participation in public finance decision making and oversight, it can lead\
  \ to better policy choices, deeper public trust in government, and stronger accountability\
  \ over the actual use of public money to provide services on the ground. Such participation,\
  \ however, is only meaningful when the public has access to information about the\
  \ government\u2019s plans, activities and the fiscal constraints it faces.\r\n\r\
  \nWhile the national government has undergone regular budget transparency and participation\
  \ assessments through the Open Budget Survey since 2006, to date there has not been\
  \ a similar assessment of public finance management systems and practices for local\
  \ and provincial governments. This is about to change, as the International Budget\
  \ Partnership South Africa is preparing to launch a Metro OBI. The Metro OBI will\
  \ complete the public finance transparency and participation picture in South Africa\
  \ by assessing transparency and participation in the metropolitan municipalities\
  \ (metros). Four of the eight metro municipalities will be assessed in 2018.\r\n\
  \r\nThis paper introduces the Metro Open Budget Index and explains how the Metro\
  \ OBI questionnaire was developed and how it will be implemented. "
