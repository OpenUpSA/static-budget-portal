importance: "The Open Budgets Portal is the first effort to create a one-stop shop for budget data worldwide with the hope of bringing visibility to countriesâ€™ efforts in this field, facilitating access and promoting use of spending data, and motivating other countries into action."
usage: |
  "1. Visit http://boost.worldbank.org/
  2. Click ""By Country"" in the menu on the left
  3. Select a country of interest
  4. Find data download links in the menu on the left
  5. Find the data user's manual in the meny on the left

  The BOOST site included various analysis tools but these seem to be out of order at the time of writing. It might be worth checking back though, by clicking ""BOOST Data Lab"" in the menu on the left on the BOOST homepage."
