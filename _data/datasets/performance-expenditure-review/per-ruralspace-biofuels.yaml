description: "The biofuels regulatory framework aims to encourage the production of\
  \ biofuel on a commercial scale by establishing transparent criteria for selecting\
  \ biofuel manufacturing projects. To achieve a 2% penetration of biofuels into the\
  \ local transport fuel pool, an incentive scheme was announced in 2013 that will\
  \ provide a guaranteed return on assets of 15% to an efficient biofuels producer.\
  \ It is hoped that the commercial production of biofuels will stimulate significant\
  \ economic development and employment in the agricultural sector. The fiscal production\
  \ incentive for biofuels will be funded by a biofuels levy on all petrol and diesel\
  \ sold for domestic consumption. The level of the incentive required to generate\
  \ the 15% return on assets in an indicative efficient biofuels plant will be determined\
  \ on a monthly basis via a biofuels incentive model. Should a biofuels manufacturer\u2019\
  s return on assets exceed 20%, a \u2018claw-back\u2019 would come into effect, in\
  \ terms of which it would pay the \u2018excessive\u2019 profits back to the subsidy\
