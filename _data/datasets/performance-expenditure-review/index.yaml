  description: There is wide agreement that South Africa produces too few artisans
    to meet the needs of the economy and that improving the efficiency and effectiveness
    of the artisan development system is important for accelerating growth and reducing
    unemployment. Indeed, the National Development Plan (NDP) sets a target of producing
    30 000 artisans a year by 2030, which would be more than double the number of
    artisans who graduated in 2013. (This was already considerably higher than the
    low point of 2005, when only 4 500 artisans graduated.)

  description: "The biofuels regulatory framework aims to encourage the production\
    \ of biofuel on a commercial scale by establishing transparent criteria for selecting\
    \ biofuel manufacturing projects. To achieve a 2% penetration of biofuels into\
    \ the local transport fuel pool, an incentive scheme was announced in 2013 that\
    \ will provide a guaranteed return on assets of 15% to an efficient biofuels producer.\
    \ It is hoped that the commercial production of biofuels will stimulate significant\
    \ economic development and employment in the agricultural sector. The fiscal production\
    \ incentive for biofuels will be funded by a biofuels levy on all petrol and diesel\
    \ sold for domestic consumption. The level of the incentive required to generate\
    \ the 15% return on assets in an indicative efficient biofuels plant will be determined\
    \ on a monthly basis via a biofuels incentive model. Should a biofuels manufacturer\u2019\
    s return on assets exceed 20%, a \u2018claw-back\u2019 would come into effect,\
    \ in terms of which it would pay the \u2018excessive\u2019 profits back to the\
    \ subsidy scheme"

  description: To enhance the quality of teaching and the outcomes of the basic education
    system, the national Department of Basic Education (DBE) developed a plan for
    the in-service training of teachers (INSET). The goal is to deepen their subject
    expertise as well as their pedagogical knowledge. The Integrated Strategic Planning
    Framework for Teacher Education and Development in South Africa emerged from extensive
    research and collaboration among a range of stakeholders, including provincial
    education departments, academics and teacher unions. It specifies what educators
    should know, and having established the nature of the gaps, identifies suitable
    institutions to provide the required training. The policy proposals are extensive
    and will require substantial public resources to implement.

  description: "Post-school education and training (PSET) is critical to South Africa\u2019\
    s future socio-economic development. It dramatically improves the employment prospects\
    \ of young people and raises their incomes from such employment. In addition,\
    \ broadening the skills base would be socially and economically transformative,\
    \ and promote economic and employment growth. A primary goal of the PSET system\
    \ has been to increase access to higher education and skills training. Government\
    \ has expanded the capacity of the universities and the technical and vocational\
    \ education and training (TVET) colleges, while also increasing funding for workplace\
    \ training. University enrolment has grown rapidly, but enrolment at TVET colleges\
    \ has grown even faster. The main mechanism for increasing access to the PSET\
    \ system for young people from poor households has been the National Student Financial\
    \ Aid Scheme (NSFAS), which has grown significantly. \u200B"

  description: The main purpose of this performance and expenditure review (PER) was
    to understand how much is being spent on provincial roads, what drives this expenditure,
    and what is being delivered. The aim was to identify where spending might be inefficient,
    which could inform policy decisions and improve value for money. The PER aimed
    to analyse the unit cost per kilometre of provincial roads, taking into account
    the different costs structures across provinces due to topographical, climatic,
    soil and other differences.

    \ it was reported that the target set for service delivery had been achieved.\
    \ The target had been to provide 400 000 households with upgraded services (in\
    \ situ or greenfield) and security of tenure between April 2010 and February 2014.\

  description: "Small, medium and microenterprises (SMMEs) can play a crucial role\
    \ in stimulating long-term economic growth and creating jobs. Government therefore\
    \ offers a range of services to support entrepreneurship and innovation in SMMEs,\
    \ under the auspices of departments such as Trade and Industry (DTI), Science\
    \ and Technology, and Small Business Development. Incubation programmes are an\
    \ important form of support to existing and aspiring SMME entrepreneurs, who get\
    \ access to both basic services (e.g. physical space, infrastructure and shared\
    \ services) and advanced services (e.g. networking opportunities, access to specialised\
    \ knowledge, and access to finance). Incubation programmes aim to improve the\
    \ early-stage survival and long-term growth prospects of SMMEs, to ensure that\
    \ they remain sustainable for more than three years after graduating from the\
    \ incubator support. \u200B"

  description: Public research institutions (PRIs), such as science councils, play
    a pivotal role in fostering innovation and technological progress. They typically
    conduct fundamental and applied industrial research, participate in the experimental
    development of innovative technologies, and provide training, consulting and other
    services. Their results are disseminated through publications, training and technology
    transfer.

    \ services for older persons, partial-care facilities for children, child protection\
    \ facilities, child- and youth care centres, as well as early childhood development\

  description: Although significant progress has been made in providing water to households
    and communities who had no access to these services before 1994, sizeable backlogs
    remain. According to the 2011 census, 2.2 million households still lack access
    to the RDP-standard water supply, and over 5 million households (or 33%) experience
    problems with their supply. Growth in sectors such as agriculture, mining and
    energy also depends heavily on reliable access to water.
