intro: "The main purpose of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) is to\
  \ enable young people from poor households to obtain a higher education. This is\
  \ essential for expanding South Africa\u2019s skills base and a powerful mechanism\
  \ for breaking the intergenerational cycle of household poverty and exclusion. Tertiary\
  \ education is unaffordable for most households (see Figure 1). While the average\
  \ full cost of study for a single year at university was about R28 000 in 2003,\
  \ this figure was three times greater than the incomes of households in the poorest\
  \ 20% of the population. It was also more than 30% greater than the annual incomes\
  \ of households in the second poorest quintile, and just 20% less than the total\
  \ income of households in the middle 20%. In 2003, in other words, none of the poorest\
  \ 50% of households could realistically afford to send a child to university."
