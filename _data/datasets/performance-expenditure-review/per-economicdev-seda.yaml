intro: "Small, medium and microenterprises (SMMEs) can play a crucial role in stimulating\
  \ long-term economic growth and creating jobs. Government therefore offers a range\
  \ of services to support entrepreneurship and innovation in SMMEs, under the auspices\
  \ of departments such as Trade and Industry (DTI), Science and Technology, and Small\
  \ Business Development. Incubation programmes are an important form of support to\
  \ existing and aspiring SMME entrepreneurs, who get access to both basic services\
  \ (e.g. physical space, infrastructure and shared services) and advanced services\
  \ (e.g. networking opportunities, access to specialised knowledge, and access to\
  \ finance). Incubation programmes aim to improve the early-stage survival and long-term\
  \ growth prospects of SMMEs, to ensure that they remain sustainable for more than\
  \ three years after graduating from the incubator support. \u200B"
