intro: "In the mid-1990s, government introduced the Integrated Nutrition Programme.\
  \ It aimed to improve the health of the poor by delivering a range of nutrition-specific\
  \ interventions (e.g. vitamin supplementation, deworming, and nutrition education)\
  \ and complementary interventions (e.g. the provision of water, sanitation and income\
  \ support to indigent households). However, malnutrition remains a significant challenge.\
  \ The most recent data shows that one in four children aged 1\u20133 years are stunted,\
  \ which is higher than in countries with comparable levels of income. Malnutrition\
  \ contributes to the relatively high levels of sickness and death among children:\
  \ of the children who died before age 5 in 2008, more than 60% were underweight\
  \ and 30% were severely malnourished."
