intro: "The Informal Settlements Service Delivery Rapid Verification Study is not\
  \ a typical performance and expenditure review (PER). It was commissioned by the\
  \ Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation in the Presidency in December\
  \ 2013 in order to help assess the extent to which government could rely on data\
  \ prepared and presented by various departments about the delivery of services to\
  \ communities and households living in informal settlements after it was reported\
  \ that the target set for service delivery had been achieved. The target had been\
  \ to provide 400 000 households with upgraded services (in situ or greenfield) and\
  \ security of tenure between April 2010 and February 2014. The aim of the study\
  \ was to assess the reliability of the data from various departments underpinning\
  \ these claims. \u200B\u200B"
