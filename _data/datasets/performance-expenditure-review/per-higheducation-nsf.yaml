intro: "One of apartheid\u2019s most malign legacies is educational, both basic and\
  \ post-school. As a result, government devotes a considerable share of its resources\
  \ \u2013 about 20% of public spending \u2013 to education and skills development.\
  \ One vehicle through which post-school education and training is financed is the\
  \ National Skills Fund (NSF), which was established in terms of the Skills Development\
  \ Act of 1998. The NSF is funded through the skills development levy, a payroll\
  \ tax introduced by the Skills Development Levies Act of 2000 to encourage learning\
  \ and development in the workplace. It receives about 20% of the levy; the rest\
  \ is allocated to Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs). These resources\
  \ fund training programmes, institutional capacity building, and research in the\
  \ post-school education and training sector. Read"
