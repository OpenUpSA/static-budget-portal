intro: "South Africa\u2019s approach to the provision of public transport is encapsulated\
  \ in the Public Transport Strategy and Action Plan (2007) and the National Land\
  \ Transport Act (2009). Together, these envisage city-wide, fully integrated, multi-modal,\
  \ mass rapid public transport networks delivered and managed largely by local governments.\
  \ The aim is to shift the delivery of public transport away from the present model,\
  \ which is based on operator-controlled, commuter-based, unimodal routes.\u200B\u200B"
