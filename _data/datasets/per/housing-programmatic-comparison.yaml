title: "PER: Housing Programmatic Comparison"
intro: The promise of better housing has been a central plank of public policy since 1994. To this end, the government has provided public finance for a range of housing programmes, collectively dubbed ‘RDP housing’. These programmes aim to establish communities and neighbourhoods with access to healthcare, education and other social amenities. One of their basic components is the construction of permanent homes with security of tenure, which provide privacy, protection against the elements, and access to potable water, sanitation and energy.
