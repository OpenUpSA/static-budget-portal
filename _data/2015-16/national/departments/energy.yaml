intro: "## Vote purpose\n\n_Formulate energy policies, regulatory frameworks and legislation,\
  \ and oversee\ntheir implementation to ensure energy security, promotion of environmentally\n\
  friendly energy carriers, and access to affordable and reliable energy for all\n\
  South Africans._\n\n\n\n## Mandate\n\nThe Department of Energy is mandated to ensure\
  \ the secure and sustainable\nprovision of energy for socioeconomic development.\
  \ It is to achieve this by\ndeveloping an integrated energy plan for the entire\
  \ energy sector, regulating\nenergy industries, and promoting investment in accordance\
  \ with the integrated\nresource plan (which focuses on electricity). A number of\
  \ acts regulate the\nenergy sector and reflect the legislative measures the department\
  \ has\ninstituted to govern the energy sector. Key among these are:\n\n  * the National\
  \ Energy Act\_(2008)\n\n  * the Petroleum Products Act\_(1977)\n\n  * the Electricity\
  \ Regulation Act (2006).\n\n  \n  \n\nThe National Energy Act\_(2008) sets out the\
  \ core aspects of the department\u2019s\nmandate and is the enabling legislation\
  \ that empowers the Minister of Energy\nto:\n\n  * ensure that diverse energy resources\
  \ are available in sustainable quantities and at affordable prices in the South\
  \ African economy to support economic growth and poverty alleviation, while taking\
  \ into account environmental considerations\n\n  * plan for the increased generation\
  \ and consumption of renewable energy, a contingency energy supply, the holding\
  \ of strategic energy feedstock and carriers, adequate investment in appropriate\
  \ upkeep, and access to energy infrastructure \n\n  * collect data and information\
  \ regarding energy demand, supply and generation\n\n  * promote electricity regulation,\
  \ energy research and the efficient generation and consumption of energy.\n\nThe\
  \ department is also mandated to regulate the petroleum industry at the\nmanufacturing,\
  \ wholesale and retail levels, through the implementation of the\nPetroleum Products\
  \ Act\_(1977). The Petroleum and Liquid Fuels Charter is\nannexed to the Petroleum\
  \ Products Amendment Act\_(2003), and outlines the\ndepartment\u2019s strategy to\
  \ effect the transformation of the industry.\n\nThe Electricity Regulation Act\_\
  (2006) establishes a national regulatory\nframework for the electricity supply industry\
  \ and introduces the National\nEnergy Regulator as the custodian and enforcer of\
  \ the national electricity\nregulatory framework. The act also provides for licences\
  \ and registration as\nthe instruments through which generation, transmission, distribution,\
  \ trading\nand the import and export of electricity are regulated.\n\nIn terms of\
  \ its policy mandate, the department is working with a range of\ndocuments and legislation,\
  \ which support the long term vision for South Africa\nto use as much renewable\
  \ energy as possible; create the necessary conditions\nto stimulate an efficient\
  \ electricity market; and position South Africa to\nbecome globally competitive\
  \ in the use of innovative technology for the\ndesign, manufacture and deployment\
  \ of state of the art nuclear energy systems,\npower reactors and nuclear fuel cycle\
  \ systems.\n\n"
