  mandate:
    content: 'The mandate of Parliament is based on the provisions of chapter 4 in
      the

      Constitution, which establishes Parliament and sets out the functions it

      performs. Parliament is elected to represent the people, to ensure government

      by the people under the Constitution, and to represent the provinces in the

      national sphere of government. It does this by electing the president,

      providing a national forum for public consideration of issues, passing

      legislation, and scrutinising and overseeing executive action.
