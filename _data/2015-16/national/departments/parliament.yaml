intro: '## Vote purpose


  _Provide the support services required by Parliament to fulfil its

  constitutional functions, assist political parties represented in Parliament

  to secure administrative support and service constituents, and provide members

  of Parliament with the necessary facilities._




  ## Mandate


  The mandate of Parliament is based on the provisions of chapter 4 in the

  Constitution, which establishes Parliament and sets out the functions it

  performs. Parliament is elected to represent the people, to ensure government

  by the people under the Constitution, and to represent the provinces in the

  national sphere of government. It does this by electing the president,

  providing a national forum for public consideration of issues, passing

  legislation, and scrutinising and overseeing executive action.
