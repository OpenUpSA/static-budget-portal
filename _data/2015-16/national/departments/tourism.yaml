intro: '## Vote purpose


  _Promote and support the growth and development of an equitable, competitive

  and sustainable tourism sector, enhancing its contribution to national

  priorities._




  ## Mandate


  The mandate of the Department of Tourism, as outlined in the Tourism Act

  (2014), is to: promote the practice of responsible tourism for the benefit of

  South Africa and the enjoyment of all its residents and foreign visitors;

  provide for the effective domestic and international marketing of South Africa

  as a tourist destination; promote quality tourism products and services;

  promote growth and development of the tourism sector; and enhance cooperation

  and coordination between all spheres of government in developing and managing

  tourism.


  In recognition of tourism as a national priority with the potential to

  contribute significantly to economic development, the 1996 White Paper on the

  Development and Promotion of Tourism in South Africa provides for the

  promotion of domestic and international tourism. The national tourism sector

  strategy provides a blueprint for the sector to meet the growth targets

  contained in the new growth path.
