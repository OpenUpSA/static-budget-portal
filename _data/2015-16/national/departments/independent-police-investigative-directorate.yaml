  mandate:
    content: "The Independent Police Investigative Directorate exercises its functions\
      \ in\naccordance with the Independent Police Investigative Directorate Act\_\
      (2011).\nThe act gives effect to the provisions of section\_206(6) of the Constitution,\n\
      which provides for the establishment of an independent police complaints body\n\
      that must investigate any alleged misconduct of, or offence committed by, a\n\
      member of the police service. The thrust of the directorate\u2019s work is to\n\
      investigate serious and priority crimes allegedly committed by members of the\n\
      South African Police Service and Municipal Police Services.\n\nThe Independent\
      \ Police Investigative Directorate Act (2011), which came into\neffect on 1\
      \ April 2012, grants the directorate an extended mandate and changes\nthe focus\
      \ of the directorate\u2019s work from a complaints driven organisation to\n\
      one that prioritises the investigative function. The new act places stringent\n\
      obligations on the South African Police Service and Municipal Police Services\n\
      to report matters that must be investigated by the directorate and ensures the\n\
      implementation of disciplinary recommendations made by the directorate.\n\n"
