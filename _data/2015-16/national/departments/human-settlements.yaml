intro: "## Vote purpose\n\n_Facilitate the creation of sustainable human settlements\
  \ and the improvement\nto household quality of life._\n\n\n\n## Mandate\n\nThe Department\
  \ of Human Settlements derives its core mandate and\nresponsibilities from section\
  \ 3 of the Housing Act\_(1997), which allows the\ndepartment, in collaboration with\
  \ provinces and municipalities, to establish\nand facilitate a sustainable national\
  \ housing development process. The\ndepartment does this by: determining national\
  \ policy and national norms and\nstandards for housing and human settlements development;\
  \ setting broad\nnational housing delivery goals, and monitoring the financial and\
  \ non-\nfinancial performance of provinces and municipalities against these goals;\n\
  building the capacity of provinces and municipalities; and promoting\nconsultation\
  \ with all stakeholders in the housing delivery chain, including\ncivil society\
  \ and the private sector.\n\n"
