  \ service and electronic communications services in\nunderserviced areas; promote\
  \ the participation of small business in the ICT\nsector; and enhance the capacity\
  \ of and exercise oversight of state owned\nenterprises. The department also contributes\
  \ to building an ICT skills base in\nthe country in order to ensure equitable prosperity\
  \ and global\ncompetitiveness.\n\nIn addition to the Electronic Communications Act\_\
  (2005), the department\u2019s\nmandate is derived from the following legislation:\n\
  \n  * the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act\_(2002)\n\n  * the Sentech\
