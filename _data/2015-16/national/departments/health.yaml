intro: '## Vote purpose


  _Provide leadership and coordination of health services to promote the health

  of all people in South Africa through an accessible, caring and high quality

  health system based on the primary health care approach._




  ## Mandate


  The Department of Health derives its mandate from the National Health Act

  (2003), which requires the department to provide a framework for a structured

  uniform health system within South Africa. The act sets out the functions of

  the three levels of government as they relate to health services. The

  department contributes directly to achieving the government outcome that calls

  for a long and healthy life for all South Africans (outcome 2).
