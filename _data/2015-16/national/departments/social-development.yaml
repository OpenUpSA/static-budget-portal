  \ enabling environment\nfor the provision of a comprehensive, integrated and sustainable\
  \ social\ndevelopment service._\n\n\n\n## Mandate\n\nThe 1997 White Paper for Social\
  \ Welfare\_sets out the principles, guidelines,\npolicies and programmes for developmental\
  \ social welfare in South Africa. It\nhas provided the foundation for social welfare\
  \ in the post-1994 era. The\nDepartment of Social Development is not established\
  \ in terms of a single act;\nseveral pieces of legislation determine its mandate:\n\
  \n  * The Social Assistance Act\_(2004) provides a legislative framework for providing\
  \ social assistance. It sets out the different types of grants payable as well as\
  \ their qualifying criteria. It also makes provision for the establishment of the\
  \ inspectorate for social assistance.\n\n  * The Non-Profit Organisations Act\_\
  (1997) establishes an administrative and regulatory framework within which non-profit\
  \ organisations can conduct their affairs, and provides for their registration by\
  \   \nthe department.\n\n  * The Older Persons Act\_(2006) establishes a framework\
  \ for empowering and protecting older persons, and promoting and maintaining their\
  \ status, rights, wellbeing, safety and security. It provides for older persons\
  \ to enjoy good quality services while staying with their families in their communities\
  \ for as long as possible. It also makes provision for older persons to live in\
  \ residential care facilities if they are unable to stay with   \ntheir families.\n\
  \n  * The Children\u2019s Act\_(2005) sets out principles relating to the care and\
  \ protection of children, and defines parental responsibilities and rights. It deals\
  \ with early childhood development, drop-in centres and early intervention, children\
  \ in alternative care such as foster care, child and youth care centres and, and\
  \ the adoption of children.\n\n  * The Prevention of and Treatment for Substance\
  \ Abuse Act\_(2008) regulates substance abuse services   \nand facilities.\n\n \
  \ * The 1998 White Paper on Population Policy for South Africa\_is aimed at promoting\
  \ the sustainable development of all South Africans by integrating population issues\
  \ with development planning in all spheres of government and all sectors of society.\n\
