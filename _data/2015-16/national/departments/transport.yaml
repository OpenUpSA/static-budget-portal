intro: "## Vote purpose\n\n_Lead the provision of an integrated, sustainable, reliable\
  \ and safe transport\nsystem through planning, developing, coordinating, promoting\
  \ and implementing\ntransport policies, regulations and strategies._\n\n\n\n## Mandate\n\
  \nThe Constitution identifies the legislative responsibilities of different\nlevels\
  \ of government with regard to airports, roads, traffic management and\npublic transport.\
  \ Transport is a function that is legislated and executed at\nall levels of government.\
  \ The implementation of transport functions at the\nnational level takes place through\
  \ public entities that are overseen by the\ndepartment, each with a specific delivery\
  \ mandate, as specified in the\nrespective sections below.\n\nThe 1996 White Paper\
  \ on Transport defines the different subsectors in the\ntransport sector. Broadly,\
  \ these are the infrastructure and operations of\nrail, pipelines, roads, airports,\
  \ harbours and the intermodal operations of\npublic transport and freight. The Department\
  \ of Transport is responsible for\nthe legislation and policies for all these sub-sectors.\n\
  \nFor the intermodal functions of public transport and freight, the guiding\ndocuments\
  \ are the National Land Transport Act\_(2009), the public transport\nstrategy and\
  \ the national freight logistics strategy.\n\nThe department is therefore responsible\
  \ for conducting sector research,\nformulating legislation and policy to set the\
  \ strategic direction of\nsubsectors, assigning responsibilities to public entities\
  \ and other levels of\ngovernment, regulating through setting norms and standards,\
  \ and monitoring\nimplementation.\n\n"
