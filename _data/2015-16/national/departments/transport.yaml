narrative:
  mandate:
    content: "The Constitution identifies the legislative responsibilities of different\n\
      levels of government with regard to airports, roads, traffic management and\n\
      public transport. Transport is a function that is legislated and executed at\n\
      all levels of government. The implementation of transport functions at the\n\
      national level takes place through public entities that are overseen by the\n\
      department, each with a specific delivery mandate, as specified in the\nrespective\
      \ sections below.\n\nThe 1996 White Paper on Transport defines the different\
      \ subsectors in the\ntransport sector. Broadly, these are the infrastructure\
      \ and operations of\nrail, pipelines, roads, airports, harbours and the intermodal\
      \ operations of\npublic transport and freight. The Department of Transport is\
      \ responsible for\nthe legislation and policies for all these sub-sectors.\n\
      \nFor the intermodal functions of public transport and freight, the guiding\n\
      documents are the National Land Transport Act\xC2\_(2009), the public transport\n\
      strategy and the national freight logistics strategy.\n\nThe department is therefore\
      \ responsible for conducting sector research,\nformulating legislation and policy\
      \ to set the strategic direction of\nsubsectors, assigning responsibilities\
      \ to public entities and other levels of\ngovernment, regulating through setting\
      \ norms and standards, and monitoring\nimplementation.\n\n"
