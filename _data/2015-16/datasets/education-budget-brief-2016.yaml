intro: "The aaa South African Constitution commits government departments to the progressive\
  \ realisation of various socio-economic rights within available resources. These\
  \ rights include the right to education, healthcare, housing and social welfare.\r\
  \n\r\nThe PSAM defines social accountability as the obligation by public officials\
  \ and private service providers to justify their performance in progressively addressing\
  \ the  above  rights  via  the  provision  of  effective  public  services.  In\
  \  order  to  effectively  realise  these  rights  through  the  delivery  of  public\
  \  services,  state  departments  and  private  service  providers  responsible\
  \  for  the  management  of  public  resources  must  implement  effective  accountability\
  \  and  service  delivery  systems.  These  include:  planning  and  resource  allocation\
  \  systems;  expenditure\r\nmanagement  systems;  performance  monitoring  systems;\
  \  integrity  systems;  and  oversight  systems.\r\n\r\nThe  effectiveness  of \
  \ these  systems  can  be  established  by  monitoring  their  information  outputs.\
  \  To  evaluate  these  systems,  the  PSAM  has  developed  a  set  of  evidence-based\
  \  tools  for  monitoring  the  information produced annually by each system. The\
  \  South  Africa  government has  committed  to  ensuring that it  addresses  the\
  \  most  pressing  social  and  economic  needs  of  those  it  servethrough  the\
  \  prioritisation  of  public  resources  within  the  annual budget.  This  budget\
  \  brief  analyses the Eastern  Cape  Department  of  Education\u2019s  ability\
  \  to  implement effective and efficient infrastructure delivery systems in 2016\
  \ as well as into the 2016/17 Medium Term Expenditure Framework"
