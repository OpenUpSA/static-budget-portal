intro: "Sufficient budget allocations are imperative in fulfilling government's obligation\
  \ to ensure the progressive realisation of socio-economic rights.  It is equally\
  \ as important for government to utilise these resources efficiently and for their\
  \ intended purpose. This requires planning and institutional capacity in order to\
  \ deliver on mandates and targets. Therefore, spending needs to be effective and\
  \ through budgetary allocations, tangible outcomes or improvements must be achieved.\
  \ Finally, resource allocation should be linked to equity, with the needs of the\
  \ most vulnerable prioritised in order to reduce disparities. \r\n\r\nWe analyse\
  \ the allocation and expenditure trends of the Department of Human Settlements over\
  \ a five-year period, therefore 2012 and 2017, at all three levels of government\
  \ in order to interrogate the reasonableness of government\u2019s budgeting for\
  \ the right to adequate housing. \r\n\r\nData is drawn from National Treasury documents-\
  \ Estimates of National Expenditure- and departmental documents, such as annual\
  \ reports."

methodology: "Inflation is the term used to describe general increases in the prices\
  \ of goods and services in the economy over time. Inflation erodes the value of\
  \ money because rising prices mean that R1 today buys you slightly more than R1\
  \ tomorrow. Departmental Annual Reports and Treasury documents tend to only provide\
  \ the nominal amounts allocated in the budget each year, unadjusted for the effect\
  \ of inflation. This makes comparing spending patterns over time difficult as the\
  \ value of the amounts allocated in previous years (i.e. what they can buy) has\
  \ changed. Therefore, when conducting an analysis of government budgets over time,\
  \ it is important to take the effects of inflation into account. Converting nominal\
  \ amounts to real amounts equalizes the value of money for each year under review,\
  \ and therefore allows us to compare much more accurately the amounts allocated\
  \ in the budget for different years.\r\n\r\nIn South Africa, the most widely used\
  \ measurement of general inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is tracked\
  \ by Statistics South Africa (StatsSA). Adjusting the nominal amounts provided in\
  \ the Estimates of National Expenditure and DHS annual reports to real amounts requires\
  \ us to make a calculation using \u2018inflators\u2019 which are based on the annual\
  \ CPI inflation rate provided by StatsSA. The CPI inflation rate and inflators used\
  \ in this budget analysis to convert nominal amounts to real amounts are shown below.\
  \ 2017 was used as the base year, hence all amounts in this chapter have been adjusted\
  \ to 2017 prices.\r\n\r\nThe nominal figures (which have been converted into real\
  \ figures for the purposes of this paper) are drawn from National Treasury\u2019\
  s 2015, 2016, and 2017 Estimates of National Expenditure (ENE). The \u2018adjusted\
  \ appropriation\u2019 figures provided in the ENE are used as a proxy for national\
  \ programme allocation figures in this report, while the \u2018audited outcome\u2019\
  \ figures represent national programme expenditure figures.  It must be noted that\
  \ there are currently no expenditure figures for the 2016/17 financial year. \r\n\
  \r\nHowever, the DHS\u2019 annual reports (2012/13 \u2013 2015/16) are used as sources\
  \ for allocation and expenditure trends with regard to the sub-programmes under\
  \ Programme 4 (Housing Development Finance). Neither the ENE publications nor annual\
  \ reports provided data for the 2016/17 financial year in this regard."
