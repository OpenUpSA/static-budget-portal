intro: "## Vision\r\n\r\nAn Inclusive, Globally Competitive Economy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
  ## Mission\r\n\r\nDrive economic growth that creates decent employment and promote\
  \ sustainable development through partnerships.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the focus of\
  \ the Department was to conduct research in order to assist in identifying gaps\
  \ in the economy and suggest possible intervention. To this end, the outcome of\
  \ the research including suggestions will be communicated to all municipalities\
  \ for implementation.\r\n\r\nFollowing the 2014 general elections, the fifth Provincial\
  \ Administration prioritised five priority sectors with the potential to create\
  \ the much needed jobs and could thus assist in reducing unemployment, poverty and\
  \ inequality in the Province. These five priority sectors are: Agriculture, ICT,\
  \ Tourism, Manufacturing and Mining. These sectors are the basis of the support\
  \ the Department is providing to small businesses and co-operatives, and this has\
  \ resulted in the following priorities aimed strengthening the said support:\r\n\
  \r\n* Development of the Provincial Tourism Act\r\n\r\n* Development of the Township\
  \ Strategy\r\n\r\n* SMME Development Strategy\r\n\r\n* Development of the Informal\
  \ Sector Strategy\r\n\r\n* Support infrastructure projects aimed at supporting co-operatives\
  \ in these sectors\r\n\r\n* Conduct research and produce a plan for the green economy\r\
  \n\r\n* Develop the Tourism Act\r\n\r\nIn terms of role delineation between the\
  \ Department and its Public Entities, the Executive Council\r\nLekgotla has adopted\
  \ the Organisational Re-design Report which paves the way for the new organisational\
  \ structure of the Department and remodeling of the Public Entities, particularly\
  \ MEGA and MTPA"
