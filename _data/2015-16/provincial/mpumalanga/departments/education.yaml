intro: "## Vision\n\nAdvancing excellence in quality education provision\r\n\r\n\n\
  \n## Mission\n\nThe Mpumalanga Department of Education commits to work with its\
  \ stakeholders to promote effective teaching and learning through good governance,\
  \ capable management and proficient leadership.\r\n\r\n\n\n## Core functions\n\n\
  Since 2001, the department has been shifting its focus from establishing broad policy\
  \ and governance structures and stabilisation of the education system, to improving\
  \ access, quality and equity. Recent policy pronouncements from the Presidential\
  \ State of the Nation Address point to the centrality of Education in driving an\
  \ accelerated and shared economic growth. 2015/2016 financial year is a beginning\
  \ of a new 5 Year Cycle 2015 \u2013 2020 whereby the focus will be on implementing\
  \ the National Development Plan through the priorities as outlined Medium Term Strategic\
  \ Framework 2014 -2019 of Government.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the outcome of\
  \ improved quality of basic education, there will be a focus on improving the quality\
  \ of teaching so that results improve, as measured by internationally benchmarked\
  \ tests. Targets have been set for the improvements in results at various grades\
  \ over time. In order to achieve this, we will be providing all schools with appropriate\
  \ learner and teacher support materials such as lesson plans, workbooks and textbooks,\
  \ to ensure proper coverage of the curriculum. Curriculum coverage and the utilisation\
  \ of these resources will be closely monitored as this is part of the non-negotiables\
  \ for the sector.\r\n\r\nThe monitoring of the implementation of the Curriculum\
  \ and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS) in both General Education Training (GET)\
  \ and Further Education Training (FET) phases of the system will be prioritised.\
  \ Some children live far away from school. Others need special education and local\
  \ schools may not offer this, and many are from poor homes. To achieve this we will\
  \ continue to make the number of no-fee schools available and to increase feeding\
  \ schemes to assist children from poor families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
