  \ people of the Northern Cape.\r\n\r\n\n\n## Mission\n\nTo serve people of the Northern\
  \ Cape by building a developmental institution for effective law\r\nmaking, public\
  \ participation, accountability and oversight over the executive and municipalities.\r\
  \n\r\n\n\n## Core functions\n\nThe Northern Cape Provincial Legislature (NCPL) can\
  \ be recognised as an arena in which citizens\u2019 needs meet government action\
  \ and where citizens needs mainly begin to receive increasing attention. Today,\
  \ the Northern Cape Provincial Legislature is recognised as a critical institution\
  \ for democratic development in the Northern Cape.\r\n\r\nAn effective Legislature\
  \ is strongly correlated with the existence of a viable democracy and an open society.\
  \ The Northern Cape Provincial Legislature on account of its Members and legislative\
  \ functions can empower ordinary citizens to participate in the development of policies\
  \ that shape their lives. Due to its oversight role the NCPL is fundamental in establishing\
  \ the rule of law, protecting human rights, overseeing transparent governance processes,\
  \ and ensuring compliance with national and provincial legislation in the Northern\
  \ Cape.\r\n\r\nThese functions, though universally recognised are not always naturally\
  \ or effectively implemented without sufficient human and financial resources. With\
  \ its budget the NCPL is able to develop programmes geared at its own development.\
  \ These programmes are aimed at strengthening representatives, transparency, accountability\
  \ and effective government.\r\n"
