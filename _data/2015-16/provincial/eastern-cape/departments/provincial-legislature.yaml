  \ in the legislative\r\nprocesses; and exercising oversight over the Executive and\
  \ other organs of state. ECPL is also\r\nresponsible for furthering cooperative\
  \ governance between provincial and local legislative institutions.\r\n\r\nThe oversight\
  \ function and the opening of the doors of the Legislature to the public continue\
  \ to be\r\nimportant areas of the Legislature\u2019s activities. Bills brought before\
  \ the Legislature by departments are\r\nscrutinized before they are tabled in the\
  \ House for debate. In this process, the stakeholder\u2019s views are\r\ntaken into\
  \ account \u2013 either by inviting them to the Legislature or by holding meetings.\
  \ These inputs are\r\nalso prepared in respect of national legislation through the\
  \ National Council of Provinces (NCOP). The\r\nLegislature also ensures that departments\
  \ spend voted funds in the prescribed manner through the\r\noversight function provided\
  \ by portfolio committees."
