intro: "## Vision\r\n\r\nThe Limpopo Legislature seeks to be a representative and\
  \ consultative body, a vanguard of people\u2019s aspirations and interests towards\
  \ a democratic, non-sexist, non-racial, united and prosperous society.\r\n\r\n\r\
  \n\r\n## Mission\r\n\r\nThe Legislature is an autonomous institution and an agent\
  \ for transformation that strives to:\r\n\r\n* Defend, strengthen, deepen and maintain\
  \ democracy;\r\n\r\n* Make quality laws and policies for the citizens of the province;\r\
  \n\r\n* Have an effective and meaningful participation of the citizens in the law-making\
  \ processes;\r\n\r\n* Articulate the needs and desires of the citizens of the province;\r\
  \n\r\n* Be a transparent, consultative and accountable institution;\r\n\r\n* Maintain\
  \ norms set nationally for the eradication of racism and gender imbalances;\r\n\r\
  \n* Have a representative and accountable budget; and\r\n\r\n* Ensure provision,\
  \ retention of competent skills and efficient utilization of human resources;\r\n\
  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Core functions\r\n\r\nThe core functions of the Legislature are reflected\
  \ in Section 104 to 124 of the Constitution. These include considering, passing,\
  \ amending or rejecting any bill before the Legislature and to initiate or prepare\
  \ legislation except money Bills. In addition the Legislature strives to ensure\
  \ that all provincial executive organs of state in the province are accountable.\
  \ This is achieved through vigorous oversight. The Legislature also provides financial\
  \ and administrative assistance to each party represented and facilitates public\
  \ involvement in its processes and committees. This is done through public participation\
  \ and petitions"
