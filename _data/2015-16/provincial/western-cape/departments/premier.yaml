  \ to improve the quality of life of all its\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Mission\r\
  \n\r\nTo embed good governance and to enable integrated service delivery in the\
  \ Western Cape through\r\npartnerships, innovation and people excellence\r\n\r\n\
  \r\n\r\n## Core funtions\r\n\r\nThe main role and function of the Department of\

  \ the Provincial Cabinet to exercise their provincial executive authority in accordance\
  \ with the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, and the Constitution\
  \ of the Western Cape, 1997.\r\n\r\nThis entails coordinating the functions of the\
  \ provincial administration and its departments through the development and implementation\
  \ of legislation and policy. In support of the role and functions of the provincial\
  \ Director-General, as reflected in section 7(3)(c) of the Public Service Act, the\
  \ Department of the Premier will therefore provide the following core functions:\r\
  \n\r\nExecutive support, providing executive governance support services;\r\n\r\n\
  Provincial strategic management, professionally supporting the Premier and Cabinet\
  \ to effectively\r\nexercise their executive authority in respect of provincial\
  \ strategic management matters; and\r\n\r\nA Corporate Services Centre, rendering\
  \ transversal corporate services on a shared services basis."
