intro: "## Vision\n\nResidents of the Western Cape have access to liveable, accessible,\
  \ safe, multi-opportunity settlements.\r\n\r\n\n\n## Mission\n\nThe mission of the\
  \ Department of Human Settlements is:\r\n\r\n* To provide settlements that offer\
  \ good basic and socio-economic services;\r\n\r\n* To offer a range of rental and\
  \ ownership options that respond to the varied needs and incomes of\r\nhouseholds;\
  \ and\r\n\r\n* To consistently improve settlements through joint citizen and government\
  \ effort supported by private\r\nsector contributions.\r\n\r\n* The Department is\
  \ committed to accelerating delivery, while promoting social cohesion through the\
  \ development of integrated and sustainable human settlements in an open society.\r\
  \n\r\n\n\n## Core functions\n\nThe main services of the Department are to:\r\n\r\
  \n* Plan and facilitate effective and efficient housing delivery in accordance with\
  \ national and provincial programmes for the development of integrated and sustainable\
  \ human settlements;\r\n\r\n* Promote and facilitate the upgrading of informal settlements;\r\
  \n\r\n* Facilitate sound relations between lessors and lessees;\r\n\r\n* Integrate\
  \ marginalised communities into economically viable, socially equitable and environmentally\r\
  \nsensitive settlements; and\r\n\r\n* Manage and maintain housing assets strategically\
  \ and effectively.\r\nThe core functions and responsibilities of the Department\
  \ are:\r\n\r\n* The planning, promotion and development of integrated and sustainable\
  \ human settlements;\r\n\r\n* Administering housing subsidies and providing technical\
  \ support for the development of sustainable human settlements;\r\n\r\n* Sensitising\
  \ the public to the importance of housing as an asset; and \r\n\r\n* Facilitating\
