intro: "## Vision\r\n\r\nThe Department\u2019s vision is a Western Cape that has a\
  \ vibrant, innovative, and sustainable economy,\r\ncharacterised by growth, employment\
  \ and increasing equity, and built on the full potential of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
  ## Mission\r\n\r\nTo achieve the vision statement as noted above, the Department\
  \ of Economic Development and Tourism will provide leadership to the Western Cape\
  \ economy through the Department\u2019s\r\nunderstanding of the economy, its ability\
  \ to identify economic opportunities and potential, and its\r\ncontribution to government\
  \ economic priorities.\r\n\r\nThe Department will also act as a catalyst for the\
  \ transformation of the economy and respond to the challenges and opportunities\
  \ of its economic citizens, in order to support the government\u2019s goal of creation\
  \ of opportunities for businesses and citizens to grow the economy and employment.\r\
  \n\r\nLastly, it will contribute to the provision of a predictable, competitive,\
  \ equitable and responsible environment for investment, enterprise and trade.\r\n\
  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Core functions\r\n\r\nWith the adoption of Strategic Goal 1: Create\
  \ opportunities for growth and jobs and its subsequent Strategic directive, the\
  \ primary focus for Vote 12: Economic Development and Tourism is squarely placed\
  \ on delivering effectively on the provision of an enabling business environment\
  \ which will allow for the private sector to grow the economy and create jobs.\r\
  \n\r\nFurthermore, there is a national drive and commitment to create jobs. This\
  \ is demonstrated by the numerous incentives associated with National Government\u2019\
  s approach to economic stimulation policies, where the emphasis has been placed\
  \ on the creation of \u201Creal work opportunities\u201D.\r\n\r\nIn this context,\
  \ this Department, has emphasised a strategic approach that will be grounded in\
  \ the need to:\r\n\r\n* Create opportunities for growth;\r\n\r\n* Increase work\
  \ opportunities for all citizens;\r\n\r\n* Creating an enabling environment for\
  \ business and citizenry growth and development; and\r\n\r\n* Creating a competitive\
  \ and productive economic Province."
