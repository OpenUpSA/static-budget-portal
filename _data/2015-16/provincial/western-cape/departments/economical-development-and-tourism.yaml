intro: "## Vision\n\nThe Department\u2019s vision is a Western Cape that has a vibrant,\
  \ innovative, and sustainable economy,\r\ncharacterised by growth, employment and\
  \ increasing equity, and built on the full potential of all.\r\n\r\n\n\n## Mission\n\
  \nTo achieve the vision statement as noted above, the Department of Economic Development\
  \ and Tourism will provide leadership to the Western Cape economy through the Department\u2019\
  s\r\nunderstanding of the economy, its ability to identify economic opportunities\
  \ and potential, and its\r\ncontribution to government economic priorities.\r\n\r\
  \nThe Department will also act as a catalyst for the transformation of the economy\
  \ and respond to the challenges and opportunities of its economic citizens, in order\
  \ to support the government\u2019s goal of creation of opportunities for businesses\
  \ and citizens to grow the economy and employment.\r\n\r\nLastly, it will contribute\
  \ to the provision of a predictable, competitive, equitable and responsible environment\
  \ for investment, enterprise and trade.\r\n\r\n\n\n## Core functions\n\nWith the\
  \ adoption of Strategic Goal 1: Create opportunities for growth and jobs and its\
  \ subsequent Strategic directive, the primary focus for Vote 12: Economic Development\
  \ and Tourism is squarely placed on delivering effectively on the provision of an\
  \ enabling business environment which will allow for the private sector to grow\
  \ the economy and create jobs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there is a national drive and\
  \ commitment to create jobs. This is demonstrated by the numerous incentives associated\
  \ with National Government\u2019s approach to economic stimulation policies, where\
  \ the emphasis has been placed on the creation of \u201Creal work opportunities\u201D\
  .\r\n\r\nIn this context, this Department, has emphasised a strategic approach that\
  \ will be grounded in the need to:\r\n\r\n* Create opportunities for growth;\r\n\
  \r\n* Increase work opportunities for all citizens;\r\n\r\n* Creating an enabling\
  \ environment for business and citizenry growth and development; and\r\n\r\n* Creating\
  \ a competitive and productive economic Province.\r\n"
