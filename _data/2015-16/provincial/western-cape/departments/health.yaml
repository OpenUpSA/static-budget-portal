  \nWe undertake to provide equitable access to quality health services in partnership\
  \ with the relevant\r\nstakeholders within a balanced and well-managed health system\
  \ to the people of the Western Cape and\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\n\n\n## Core functions\n\
  \nWestern Cape Government: Health is primarily responsible for providing health\
  \ services to the population of the Province, approximately 6.246 million of which\
  \ 75 per cent is estimated to be uninsured. Tertiary hospitals are considered to\
  \ be a national resource and therefore obliged to provide for people beyond the\r\
  \nprovincial borders, and this is in line with the National Tertiary Services Grant.\r\
  \n\r\n* The Department will continue to provide a comprehensive, cost-effective\
  \ package of health services to the\r\npeople of the Western Cape. This includes\
  \ preventive, promotive, curative, and rehabilitative and palliative\r\ncare via:\r\
  \n\r\n* District health services including: home and community-based care, clinics,\
  \ community day/health\r\ncentres and district hospitals.\r\n\r\n* Provincial, central\
  \ and specialised hospital services, which include hospitals such as Tuberculosis,\r\
  \nPsychiatric and Rehabilitation hospitals.\r\n\r\n* Emergency medical and planned\
  \ patient transport services.\r\nForensic pathology: medico-legal and inspector\
  \ of anatomy services."
