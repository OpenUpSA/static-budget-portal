  \ national and provincial departments implemented in a local space in the municipal\
  \ IDPs.\r\n\r\n* Ensure that IDP encapsulates the provincial priorities and budget\
  \ in a co-ordinated manner.\r\n\r\n* Enhance the IGR framework support integration\
  \ (IGR framework to be reviewed and strengthened).\r\n\r\n* Ensure seamless service\
  \ delivery in a co-ordinated manner supported by emerging legislated processes.\r\
