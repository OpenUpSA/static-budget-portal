intro: "## Vision\n\nThe vision of the Department of Health is: A long and healthy\
  \ life for all South Africans.\r\n\r\n\n\n## Mission\n\nThe department\u2019s mission\
  \ statement is: To develop a sustainable, co-ordinated, integrated and comprehensive\
  \ health system at all levels of care, based on the primary health care approach\
  \ through the district health system.\r\n\r\n\n\n## Core functions\n\nThe main purpose\
  \ of the department is to develop and implement a sustainable, co-ordinated, integrated\
  \ and comprehensive health system based on the primary health care approach, which\
  \ encompasses promotive, curative, rehabilitative, supportive and palliative care.\
  \ This is guided by the principles of accessibility, equity, quality and efficiency,\
  \ sustainability, community participation, appropriate technology, and inter-governmental\
  \ and inter-sectoral collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe department provides health services\
  \ primarily to the uninsured population of KZN, who comprise\r\nabout 86.6 per cent\
  \ of the province\u2019s total population of 10 694 400 (2014 Mid-Year Population\
  \ Estimates, Stats SA). In addition, the department provides central health services\
  \ to people beyond\r\nprovincial boundaries. The following main categories of health\
  \ services provided by the department are:\r\n\r\nPrimary health care services\r\
  \n\r\nPrimary health care services are rendered at community/household level and\
  \ in fixed clinics and include the promotion of health and prevention of illness,\
  \ as well as curative and rehabilitative services.\r\n\r\n\r\nHospital services\r\
  \n\r\nDistrict hospitals render hospital services at a general practitioner level,\
  \ while provincial hospitals render\r\nhospital services at a specialist level.\
  \ Specialised hospitals render specialised hospital services for patients\r\nwith\
  \ TB, psychiatric illnesses and those patients requiring long-term or chronic step-down/rehabilitative\r\
  \ncare. Tertiary and central hospitals render tertiary, central and quaternary hospital\
  \ services at specialist\r\nlevel. Central and tertiary hospitals provide facilities\
  \ and expertise for sophisticated medical procedures.\r\n\r\nForensic pathology\
  \ services\r\n\r\nRendering specialised forensic and medico-legal services to establish\
  \ the circumstances and causes\r\nsurrounding unnatural death, to ensure integrity\
  \ of forensic evidence and to provide Inspector of Anatomy\r\nServices.\r\n\r\n\
  Emergency medical services\r\n\r\nThe aim of this category is to provide emergency\
  \ care and transport for victims of trauma, road traffic\r\naccidents, and emergency\
  \ medical and obstetric conditions. Planned patient transport is provided for interhospital\r\
  \ntransfer, while indigent patients are transported between clinics and hospitals\r\
