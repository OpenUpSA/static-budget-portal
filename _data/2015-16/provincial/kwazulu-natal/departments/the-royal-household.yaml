intro: "## Note\n\nIt must be noted that Proclamation No. 83 of 2014, which was signed\
  \ by the President of South Africa on\n12 of December 2014, combines Vote 10: The\
  \ Royal Household with Vote 1: Office of the Premier. In\nline with the recommendations\
  \ of the A-G, this merging is effective from 1 April 2015 and, therefore, the\n\
  functions and budget of the Royal Household (including the public entity, the Royal\
  \ Household Trust) are\nadded to Vote 1\u2019s functions and budget. As such, there\
  \ is no Vote 10 chapter in the 2015/16 EPRE. See\nthe departmental chapter relating\
  \ to Vote 1: Office of the Premier on pages 1 to 46."
