narratives:
- content: "It must be noted that Proclamation No. 83 of 2014, which was signed \
    \ by the President of South Africa on 12 of December 2014, combines Vote 10: \
    \ The Royal Household with Vote 1: Office of the Premier. In line with the \
    \ recommendations of the A-G, this merging is effective from 1 April 2015 and, \
    \ therefore, the functions and budget of the Royal Household (including the \
    \ public entity, the Royal Household Trust) are added to Vote 1â€™s functions \
    \ and budget. As such, there is no Vote 10 chapter in the 2015/16 EPRE. See \
    \ the departmental chapter relating to Vote 1: Office of the Premier on pages \
    \ 1 to 46."
