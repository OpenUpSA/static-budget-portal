    <p>National Treasury is working in partnership with IMALI YETHU<sup>1</sup> to develop an online budget data portal. This online budget data portal is part of National Treasury’s continued commitment to transparency and budget participation reforms. As is well known internationally (see SA’s ranking in the Open Budget Index 2015 country assessment – 3rd out of 102 countries), National Treasury already publishes extensive budgetary information on its website, however it has been observed over time that the use of this data is not as extensive as it could be. The portal will therefore publish data in a user-friendly format, to enable more effective information sharing, analyses and research. The portal will support involvement by civil society and the public in the budget process and enable citizens to have informed discussions in different government policy areas.</p>

    <p><sup>1</sup> IMALI YETHU is an open coalition of civil society organisations driven by an interest in promoting budget transparency and public participation. Members are in active support of the development of the budget portal and seek to promote wider civic participation across all sectors of South African society. </p>
    
    <h3 id="open-government-partnership-south-africa-commitment-two">Open Government Partnership – South Africa Commitment Two</h3>
    
    <p>South Africa is a founding member of the multilateral <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/">Open Government Partnership</a> (OGP) initiative that “aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance". Each member government is required to submit an action plan containing commitments. South Africa's OGP commitment two is in respect of Open Budgeting and National Treasury, working together with Civil Society Organisations, is responsible for the attainment of this commitment. This commitment requires involvement of civil society in various aspects of the budget process from planning to implementation and monitoring and evaluation, enabling citizens to have a firmer grasp of how national resources are generated, distributed and reported upon.</p>
    
    <h3 id="development-stages">Development stages</h3>
    
    <p>Given the complexity, the portal will be built in stages. The different development stages are essentially distinguished by the scope of data made available in each stage. After the planning stage, the project will now deliver to four stages of data availability:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Planning stage: Mapping out a project plan showing when and how different stakeholders will be engaged, what the terms of reference will be for appointing a technical team, the technical specifications, as well as the longer-term plan providing for where the portal will be hosted and resources required for its maintenance, daily operations etc.</li>
      <li>Stage 1: Data currently available within the National Treasury as well as budget-related data within the domain of civil society organisations [data repository with currently existing data; and collaboration platform].</li>
      <li>Stage 2: Local and internationally released data, such as data on GDP and IMF world economic data. Links to other already established databases and datasets provided by other national institutions.</li>
      <li>Stage 3: Wider government institutional information, including performance information and procurement information. There could be various sources of this data. Custodians are the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME), the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO) and line departments, etc.</li>
      <li>Stage 4: Spatial data providing a view of budget-related information at National, Provincial, Public Entities and Municipal levels across sectors, by economic classification. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 id="your-contribution">Your contribution</h3>
    
    <p>The budget portal presents an exciting opportunity for members of the public, CSOs, academia, business and government departments to contribute and to:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Provide input on the most USEFUL budget information produced by the National Treasury and by other government institutions.</li>
      <li>Upload USEFUL budget information generated by non-governmental institutions and citizens.</li>
      <li>Indicate which data sets and spreadsheet formats are USEFUL.</li>
      <li>Help develop USEFUL illustrations and aggregation tools for different levels of technical sophistication.</li>
      <li>Participate on interactive platforms that are USEFUL alongside producers and other users of information and contribute to the publication of additional information.</li>
      <li>Have USEFUL and informed discussions in different government policy areas about service delivery.</li>
      <li>Ultimately contribute to developing a portal that promotes meaningful engagement and fosters public participation in the budget process </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 id="main-tasks">Main tasks</h3>
    
    <p>The main tasks of the project team are:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Develop an application programme interface (API) and ensure that the raw data is available in a user-friendly format via the API.</li>
      <li>Build an easily accessible, user friendly online budget data portal where budget related documents and guidance material can be brought together in a single location in a way that is educative and interactive. This includes facilitating and developing the mockups of the portal that will be assessed.</li>
      <li>Develop a communications strategy and implement a project communications campaign that is centred on widespread public participation.</li>
      <li>Develop a stakeholder engagement plan and implement through engagement with civil society organisations to select the ideal portal design.</li>
      <li>Enhance public participation opportunities and develop civic information products and execute a nationwide civic education drive.</li>
      <li>Create links to relevant local and international data sources. </li>
      <li>Undertake ongoing hosting and maintenance arrangements.</li>
      <li>Provide data updates.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="development-approach">Development approach</h3>
    
    <p>Many IT projects that use the traditional waterfall approach of extensive design upfront do not work well, are delivered late, or are over budget. </p>
    
    <p>This project is utilising an agile approach. The agile approach is one of iterative development in rapid cycles will allow data to be made available in the phased manner. The agile development principles encourage active ‘user’ involvement throughout the product’s development and will serve to ensure that the data provision is responsive to user needs. Civil society and citizens’ inputs will be incorporated into the IT development, in order to ensure product development alignment to user needs. </p>
    
    <p>A number of opportunities for civil society engagement and partnership with the project have been identified along the full life-cycle of the project.</p>
    
    <h3 id="current-project-status">Current project status</h3>
    
    <p>A Project Steering Committee and Operational Working Group comprised of National Treasury officials and representatives of IMALI YETHU was set up to provide strategic and operational guidance to the project. The Government Technical Advisory Centre was brought on board to support with the planning and project management of the project. </p>
    
    <p>A project planning phase was undertaken to scope the project, working together with Civil Society organisations. Thereafter, an open tender process was undertaken to secure a service provider to support the implementation of the project. In keeping with the partnership approach, Civil Society Organisations observed the procurement process. The tender was awarded to OpenUp. The official project commencement date was 4th August 2017. </p>
    
    <p>Stage one of the project is currently underway. During stage one there will be a series of DataQuests designed to understand user needs, in order to direct the development of the portal. The first DataQuest has already been held in Pretoria on 26 September 2017. The purpose of the Data Quest is soley to understand the needs of potential users of the data in order to determine the user features that will need to be developed for the portal. Different participants who are passionate about government policy analysis and its supporting data, from government, private sector and civil society were in attendance and participated in discussions and provided inputs.</p>
    
    <p>On 22 November 2017, there will be a second DataQuest in Cape Town. This will be followed by a two-day Hackathon on 23 and 24 November 2017. This is in line with the agile IT development process that is being used for this project. DataQuests are planned for each Province.</p>

    <p><small>By <a href="http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=author&id=11608">Simnikiwe Mzekandaba</a>, IT in government editor<br>Johannesburg, 28 Sep 2017</small></p>
    
    <p>National Treasury partners with civil society organisations to develop an online budget data portal.</p>
    
    <p>South African citizens will soon be able to access easier to understand information from government's annual budget presented by finance minister Malusi Gigaba.  </p>
    
    <p>National Treasury told ITWeb it is in stage one of the development phase of an online budget data portal, with the first version expected to go live around the tabling of the main budget in February 2018.</p>
    
    <p>According to Treasury, it already publishes extensive budgetary information on its Web site; however, it has observed over time that the use of this data is not as extensive as it could be.</p>
    
    <p>The portal will therefore publish data in a user-friendly format, which should enable more effective information-sharing, analysis and research. In turn, it should support involvement of civil society and the public in the budget process and enable citizens to have informed discussions in different government policy areas, says the government finances managing entity.</p>
    
    <p>"The intention of the online budget data portal project is to provide the data in a more user-friendly format and present a readily comprehensible overview of how public resources are generated and used. Primarily the aim is to improve the use of budget data for understanding government policy and service delivery."</p>
    
    <p>The project, a partnership initiative between Treasury and civil society organisations like Public Service Accountability Monitor, and Mobile Social Accountability and Monitoring, is being developed using a modularised approach to allow for continuous engagements with stakeholders, says Treasury.</p>
    
    <p>The development process of the online portal is said to involve extensive outreach to citizens to determine what stakeholders really want to know about the budget and in what format they find it most useful.</p>
    
    <p>It will be developed only after numerous consultations of what really works for citizens, Treasury points out.</p>
    
    <p>Ultimately, Treasury has envisioned a budget portal that will be a multimedia platform where many data-informed views on budgets can be posted and responded to.</p>
    
    <p>"The portal will be designed based on meeting citizens' needs; it is being built specifically for this purpose… A number of engagements in the form of data quests and hackathons are planned across the country to get citizens' insights and inputs.</p>
    
    <p>"At an appropriate time, there will also be a competition that will be made public, for citizens to propose the name of this online budget data portal. Civil society organisations will lead this activity." •</p>

    <p><small>SABC<br>Wednesday 27 September 2017 14:18</small></p>
    
    <p>National Treasury has embarked on an ambitious project along with civil society to develop an open budget portal that will go live in February 2018. According to the International Budget Partnership’s 2015 Open Budget Survey, South Africa has one of the top three transparent budgets in the world.More than 70 interested parties gathered at 012Central in Pretoria on Tuesday 26 September to participate in a stakeholder event that gathered input on the development of the portal. National Treasury chief director of expenditure planning, Dr. Kay Brown says this was one of several events that will take place around the country as Treasury engages with civil society on the development of the open budget portal.</p>

    <p>“We have a lot of transparency but not a lot of participation in the budget in the sense that we don’t have an informed debate on government policy,” says Brown.Brown goes on to explain that before Treasury would go on post-budget speech tours at universities and other institutions but not much else would happen with regards to participation in the budgeting process and policies. Treasury now wants to reach out to civil society and other groups such as religious organizations on to see how they’d use the national budget as a tool to change service delivery to make it meaningful for them.Public Service Accountability Monitor director, Jay Kruuse says they’ve been involved in the development of the portal and are supportive of it in order to improve communication and participation between communities and government around government funding.“The open budget portal is part of an initiative by Treasury driven by improving openness,” says Kruuse, “South Africa is a signatory of the <a href="https://www.opengovpartnership.org/">Open Government Partnership</a> (OGP) and commitment two of the OGP is to develop an open government portal.”Open Up SA director Adi Eyal says development of the portal is an iterative process and will involve a number of stakeholder events and hackathons that will take place around the country over the next three years.“We want one thousand people to make a significant contribution to the project by the end of it,” says Eyal. •</p>
