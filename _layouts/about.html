  <p>National Treasury is working in partnership with IMALI YETHU to develop an online budget data 1 portal.</p>

  <p>This online budget data portal is part of National Treasury’s continued commitment to transparency and budget participation reforms. As is well known internationally (see <a href="https://www.internationalbudget.org/wp-content/uploads/OBS2015-Report-English.pdf" target="_blank" class="Page-link">SA’s ranking in the Open Budget Index 2015 country assessment – 3rd out of 102 countries</a>), National Treasury already publishes extensive budgetary information on its website however it has been observed over time that the use of this data is not as extensive as it could be.</p>

  <p>The portal will thereforepublish data in a user-friendly format, to enable more effective information sharing, analyses and research. The portal will support involvement by civil society and the public in the budget process and enable citizens to have informed discussions in different government policy areas.</p>

    <div class="Page-subTitle">The Open Government Partnership</div>

    <p>South Africa is a founding member of the multilateral Open Government Partnership (OGP) initiative that “aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance" (<a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/" class="Page-link">http://www.opengovpartnership.org/</a>).</p>

    <p>Each member government is required to submit an action plan containing commitments. South Africa's OGP commitment two is in respect of Open Budgeting and National Treasury, working together with Civil Society Organisations, is responsible for the attainment of this commitment.</p>

    <p>This commitment requires involvement of civil society in various aspects of the budget process from planning to implementation and monitoring and evaluation, enabling citizens to have a firmer grasp of how national resources are generated, distributed and reported upon.</p>
