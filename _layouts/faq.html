        <h2 class="Card-title">How does the search function work?</h2>
        <p>The search box helps you to find budgets and datasets you may be interested in.</p>

        <p>When you use the search box, we’ll try to find the most applicable budgets for your search terms. We use budget datasets and documents to help guide the results, not just department names. We do our best, but can’t always find the best budget for you. If you’re unable to find what you’re looking for please email us at feedback@vulekamali.gov.za and let us know.</p>
